So at this point, you think you have maybe two or three options for how to best make this meal even better.<|endoftext|>It sounds like some of the forces at work here are
T....and.<|endoftext|>With all of the talk about food and being responsible, it sounds like your kids really influence you in terms of how you think about eating.<|endoftext|>So your kids are really important to you at this
T.... you just don't see any signs of progress.<|endoftext|>T. All right. So you think having a healthy relationship with your children is important to you and your family.<|endoftext|>COLUMBUS, Ohio--(A sigh of relief when you realize that your

So now your family is pretty busy trying to manage that pre - diabetes and other things that come up after that.<|endoftext|>T.

And overwhelmed with uhh, where to even begin right now?<|endoftext|>A little overwhelmed with uhh, where to even begin right now?<|endoftext|>At this point you don't have a lot of time for yourself, and you've got a lot of responsibilities for the school, and everyone's busy, and so time is of the essence with you.<|endoftext|>A lot to take care
It sounds like family is really important to you.<|endoftext|>So the pressure is on you really to kind of step up and do something about it. And, just, just take your time to do it.<|endoftext|>Have a good day.
Okay. Um, so that's really the thing. Um, maybe that's why you didn't want to talk about the number at all. Because then you might be letting yourself off the hook a little bit.<|endoftext|>It's like getting your weight in to the point where you feel like it's not sustainable.<|endoftext|>Mm hmm. So, you've mentioned several times, um, having your daughter....<|endoftext|>You have

And you told me that it will be a while, that you need time
T. And although youre a 2 or 3, 3, so far in the future that's something that you don't see changing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've had a couple of things in your life already where you can be successful at times. You have made some success in the past at things like that but it doesn't sound like those things are necessarily the things that...it's like adjusting on a daily basis.<|endoftext|>Sometimes when you do manage to stick to a diet it seems like it's because you do really well on it and you are successful at keeping your weight off.<|endoftext|>The path of the fad diets seems to...is sometimes to be much easier to
Um, so for your family it's really important, um, you think, and important for your health. So what I've been hearing from you today is that, um, you really want to make a change, and you're feeling like the weight that you've gained in the past is really scary and, um, you've experienced that it can cause you to have
T. Natural changes, yeah.<|endoftext|>So not only do we have a franchise where we have fast food options, we have the option to eat that same cuisine at home.<|endoftext|>We also have the option of coming over for lunch.<|endoftext|>T. Ok.
And energetic.<|endoftext|>He's been doing some work with his father and I mean, it seems like he's been really busy and maybe not even able to join forces with his fast food diet in kind of trying to lose weight. So, maybe considering maybe cutting out the fast food and just having a conversation about...<|endoftext|>It's hard because you have so much going on during the day that you
so your kids are really important to you<|endoftext|>It sounds like your children are really important to you and that - in a way they are sort of being played - by the parents - by not being able to be there for them.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like you have been active before in sports<|endoftext|>It sounds like when you are exercising that you are doing so much better.<|endoftext|>You are sweating and sweating. You are sweating and sweating.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your body is being worked on.
T. Um, and, so for you, your kids and your, your work. It's hard because you want to eat healthy but you
T. And it sounds like you both really value that experience and that companionship and you really want to get back to that.<|endoftext|>On Monday night, the family was getting together for a snack break while the kids were out. And it sounds like you brought up exercise too.<|endoftext|>You know it sounds like there's maybe a little bit of something for everybody.
Yeah. So it sounds like when you cook that the taste is much more of a factor because the foods that you're going to
T. And so you're really motivated to kind of, um, spend that time making sure you take the steps necessary to hopefully reverse that.<|endoftext|>A little overwhelmed with all the new information all the sudden.
Um, yeah it
And healthy things are just really sweet.<|endoftext|>It's been a while? So what kind of things have you been doing recently? You've recently been busy...<|endoftext|>T. Just kind of...like you mentioned doing some exercise and you did some gardening. You know...but gardening seems like it...it doesn't really take up a lot of time. You know in terms of time you have, like energy.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds like you've been really busy kind of...as the past
And then you mentioned just maybe a change for lunch break...<|endoftext|>A girl just has to be a good parent, right? There are a lot of things that go into this and making sure that the two of those things are balanced are really important.<|endoftext|>It sounds like family is
T. Yes, I mean it can be very frustrating right now.<|endoftext|>Aura: Something that would help
T. So you've seen your father<|endoftext|>About four years ago, around the time of the Arab uprisings, you watched as your father struggled with diabetes and he went to this pre - diabetes class, this is
T. And not just talk about helping your body um with maybe losing weight.<|endoftext|>Because of the complications that...<|endoftext|>Yeah so you've got the diabetes diagnosis. But you don't quite know how to... Because of the complications, yeah so what... So you haven't really had diabetes in your family,
OK, so that's very frightening and maybe even terrifying.<|endoftext|>The family is really important to you.<|endoftext|>It's a very stressful thing for you to be dealing with, because your father is dealing with this and you don't want that to happen.<|endoftext|>It seems like there
T. You're scared because your other family members have also experienced this, you know, cut off like, ties that you really enjoy. So, it sounds like something you're very nervous about.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you really value being a mom and being there for your children, and this is something that they've struggled with and have also experienced through divorce
so you're saying that confidence could be very important.<|endoftext|>You'll have to be more aware of these health concerns even though your students are very active....<|endoftext|>It sounds like your kids are impacted by your weight as well.<|endoftext|>It sounds like
T. On the other hand, at the end of the day you're going to cook almost all the time so there's not a lot of time for you to really commit yourself to doing anything.<|endoftext|>Not only are you not eating healthy but you're also having a lot of difficulty in losing weight.<|endoftext|>You've made changes that are of a personal
So, you're thinking, " Ask yourself, " " is, " do I feel like this is what I'm actually doing right now? "<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a pretty busy lifestyle and you have a lot going on. So, um, on the one hand, doing all of your work and having a lot of... like, time
So it sounds like there's a lot of things going on here. A lot of health concerns.<|endoftext|>The recent news about the fad diets involving cabbage soup and york soup has kind of scared you.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your children are impacted by any weight loss program you choose.<|endoftext|>Okay. So sounds like if you adjusted the diet in one way it might be temporary and that will work for you.<|endoftext|>A you may not be so motivated to come back in to work.<|endoftext|>The morning after school. Mm-mm. Sounds like that's actually the night before.<|endoftext|>A lot to take in. Maybe taking
T. Something to look at.<|endoftext|>A little too extreme for you.<|endoftext|>Yea. Sounds like, um, being a stay at home mom is something that you struggle with and that can be very difficult.<|endoftext|>I don't want to overstep...you're not too confident you'll be successful.<|endoftext|>A little
T. Umm. Your kids. Umm, making sure that their healthy.<|endoftext|>KFC is a fast food restaurant. It's a good choice if you have that much time for yourself
So it just kind of fell out of the picture.<|endoftext|>Good parent. And responsible. Sounds like your kids are really important to you and that you want them to benefit from any weight loss program you choose.<|endoftext|>It sounds like family is really important to you.<|endoftext|>
T. It's also something that you know you don't necessarily have the time for necessarily.<|endoftext|>T. On the other hand time is of the essence with you.<|endoftext|>You said that you have a sister who is diabetic and she has knee pain if I'm not mistaken.<|endoftext|>So this is also sort of a concern for you about your weight gain. And you did mention in the past that you've been pretty active.<|endoftext|>You know there was maybe some weight gain that may
About three.<|endoftext|>T. Right, so you've recently found out that the weight loss program that you tried in the past did not work for you.<|endoftext|>Yeah, it can be hard to stick with it long term
Right. So it could also be a bonding experience for you and your children.<|endoftext|>Okay so I'm going To start out with a quick review of what we've got so far. Um. You know so we've got the diagnosis. We've got the new diagnoses and the thing that's going to really help you
You are very concerned.<|endoftext|>KFC, the fast food restaurant chain, also known as Wendy's or Burger King, is notorious for its unhealthy food. It's usually found in fast food restaurants.<|endoftext|>Aisha a guest Mar 14th, 2015 416 Never a guest416Never

 There's just
you didn't mention anything about the divorce though.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you know that's been a stressful thing for you and it
Yeah. So it's just very frustrating when you feel like you've failed, almost.<|endoftext|>It's frustrating because you tried everything and nothing's worked, and now it's coming all right back on.<|endoftext|>You are frustrated with this, with the choice between fad diets and the more sustainable diets that are out there.<|endoftext|>So it seems like there's a little bit of everyman's gotta have his cake and eat it too, is sort of the theme here.<|endoftext|>Okay. So the theme is, um, about the importance of being a good parent and being responsible for your children. Um, and just the word " responsibility " itself is getting a little bit bit difficult because you're not sure, um, how to be a
Okay. So you do most of your cooking on the weekends.<|endoftext|>You need something you can fit into your day....in that you don't want to be a burden on your kids.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you definitely don't want to be a burden at home, um, maybe becoming a mother yourself, since your kids are so busy, which makes it hard to find time to make better meals.<|endoftext|>It's been a while? So
T. So it sounds like you are really, you're really looking forward to trying these diets, and doing some cooking as well.<|endoftext|>A recent poll by the Harris Poll found that one in four Americans said that they would have to change their behaviors because of the weight gain or weight loss because of the diabetes diagnosis.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're ready! You're ready! You're ready!<|endoftext|>A lot of care and
You know, it sounds like, you know, you have two teenage sons.<|endoftext|>Tip: _____ _____ Ok. Something for you to look at.<|endoftext|>You know it sounds like you
you mentioned umm good parent.<|endoftext|>A good parent is a good parent. And you're saying that if you have kids, you don't want them to be role models for your children.<|endoftext|>Any parent can be a role model for your children. And
Yeah, you've kind of seen the effects, though, of everything you've tried, it hasn't worked, it just, it's just been, it's been fruitless, it's just, it's just gone.<|endoftext|>When you know something is going on it's almost like a curse because
About an eight.<|endoftext|>A little concerned about your health...<|endoftext|>A little concerned about your health. Diagnosis, maybe. But also, just maybe, you don't want to go down that path yourself.<|endoftext|>A little
You don't want to be constantly focused on it.<|endoftext|>About two months ago I was given a set of guidelines for new members at, who are starting out as new members. These were really helpful and laid
45. Um... and everything just has been like hitting a wall.<|endoftext|>From left to right: bras and panties. from left to right: bras and panties. Okay. So, fad diets have been around for a while. You know, you've tried some diets in the past. They haven't worked.
Ok, so kind of your mom is umm overweight and your daughter<|endoftext|>Any of these diagnoses could be signs of pre - diabetes or you know pre - diabetes. Confused at this point?<|endoftext|>A: That's not for you. You already have one or two things that are signs of pre - diabetes.<|endoftext|>It sounds like there is a lot of interest in this class
Okay yea so your okay with just having your, your kids.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your parents are really important to you and that -<|endoftext|>There's a lot of responsibility in the job market right now. There's a lot of energy. And your kids are really important.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your job is pretty important
An eight?<|endoftext|>A little concerned about your health. Especially given your family history. What happened, um, to your father?<|endoftext|>You said that your father was a
So it is a potential side effect of the change you're wanting to make?<|endoftext|>You tried some exercise and gained a little bit of weight in the past but you didn't feel it was a sustainable thing for you. Maybe that's why you're ready to suffer through that.<|endoftext|>A couple of months ago we had a group exercise class where we got really good information from the teacher about some of the things that we were able to do in the past when we did exercise that worked. In terms of
Yes, so this is frustrating for you, and it's to kind of drive you to, like, some other, some other type of solution.<|endoftext|>T. Okay. So basically, what we've been talking about is that when you go out to eat out on the weekends you're usually going to grab something fast and -<|endoftext|>It sounds like your children are impacted by the way you manage your time.<|endoftext|>A chaotic finale to the day.
It's like being at work and having to deal with the kids.<|endoftext|>A 9 or an 8? Not just a 9. So, it makes it very difficult, very frustrating, to find time to make these healthy meals at
Because you haven't heard anything definitive from your doctor as to whether or not this is something...um...you know, you are maybe concerned about your health and your weight gain is prediabetic type.<|endoftext|>You must really be really worried.<|endoftext|>It's kind of frightening knowing the outcome potentially<|endoftext|>Okay. So this is actually a really good example of a success for you.
you're a little bit concerned that this might get in the way of you doing something about this.<|endoftext|>You said it's a concern for you with your medical history, but I'm wondering if you really understand how important it is for you to lose weight.<|endoftext|>A little frustrated.
Yeah. You tried this before and it just has stuff not - it's not good.<|endoftext|>
You're frustrated.<|endoftext|>You just don't know how to modify it or how to fit it into your schedule. It's...<|endoftext|>You are struggling with finding a way that you can be active at work and have
Right, exactly. It's starting to feel okay.<|endoftext|>Dear Reader:
You don't want to be stuck in the kitchen. I mean
So you see yourself, that being a good parent and energetic is very important to you.<|endoftext|>A good parent.<|endoftext|>You don't want to be a burden to your children, you said, and want to be there for them.<|endoftext|>On the one hand, you want to be able to be there for your children and be there for them and be there
If I were able to make better choices that maybe, um, maybe would, um, and not be as frustrating as it might be.<|endoftext|>It's like switching on a light is like getting a little bit more exercise.<|endoftext|>T. Ok, so that may be why you and your family are moving here.<|endoftext|>It could also be the reason you don't want to have children.<|endoftext|>T. Ok, and so we have good parent - or responsible adults who
It's kind of like a situation where you feel trapped and out of control and you wanna eat but you can't quite feel like youre able to do that because your schedules and your kids are all around you and you're trying to manage that?<|endoftext|>I mentioned class here but you don't have the time for that.<|endoftext|>Because of your busy schedule you don't have as much time for cooking as you would like. So it might seem like
Something like that?<|endoftext|>Okay so a lower number for that. So it sounds like you're hearing a little bit of a lower number.<|endoftext|>It sounds like making smaller changes is important to you.<|endoftext|>At a time when the months of January and February are over and -<|endoftext|>So you've been really busy schedule, maybe makes this a little bit easier. You mentioned you've got this new job and you've been following it really closely.<|endoftext|>It can be a little bit easier said. You've also got a lot going on, um, over the weekend.
T. Getting up and moving.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you're terrified
That it's overwhelming and you're struggling with how to make sense of it, what's going on, and what, uh, how to, uh, what are some things that you, you know, might be able to do to, uh, to, to, uh, control it
T. You also mentioned that sometimes family is really important to you.<|endoftext|>A group of eight teenage boys enjoy each other....That
T. So you have a lot of concerns about your health.<|endoftext|>That sounds like a pretty scary though for you. It sounds like that can happen to you.<|endoftext|>A mother with two kids.<|endoftext|>Alyssa is a very good mother and she takes care of her kids. She even goes out to eat on the weekends.<|endoftext|>T. So it sounds like you're very motivated to,
15. Yeah, so you really want to make sure that she gets the same kind of treatment as you.<|endoftext|>A few minutes ago you were talking about how sometimes when you go out to eat out during fast food's lunch break you
Yeah, so you're very conscious of um, being, um, with this as an example for your children.<|endoftext|>If you didn't do something about it then your children would.<|endoftext|>T. And that's a concern for you that you don't want to have in your children?<|endoftext|>
And um, you mentioned that it - it's hard to get the time when you have to take care of the kids.<|endoftext|>It sounds like a very important time for you to invest.<|endoftext|>: What time did you get that diagnosis from your doctor and -<|endoftext|>Awareness of the umm and the importance of figuring out what your next steps should be. Arri
So kind of feeling like you've crossed another turn.<|endoftext|>So a lot of these relate to, um, issues with, um, eating in the house and driving.<|endoftext|>Okay. So your schedule and your kids really influence your meal choices then?<|endoftext|>So
Ok, so it sounds like uh making smaller changes is important to you.<|endoftext|>The idea of moving one day a week seems like a little too much of a change to make in order to kind of make this a family thing.<|endoftext|>So that's that one option is to consider just maybe getting some exercise. On the other hand, you mentioned that you are a mother.<|endoftext|>It's helpful to be with your kids.<|endoftext|>Okay. It's helpful to be with your kids but it seems like sometimes those healthy
Because it's very...It's very serious and it can happen very fast and it can lead to some very serious complications.<|endoftext|>You don't want to be a burden
So, what kind of things...<|endoftext|>At this point, the only options available right now are fast food options. You may as well as Wendy's and Burger King.<|endoftext|>
There were four.<|endoftext|>About four.<|endoftext|>About four.<|endoftext|>It's okay. So basically what we're talking about is that when you lose weight you go on a program that you initially adhere to that initially makes it very difficult.<|endoftext|>You want to be able to make that change and you feel that it's something that really connects with your lifestyle that you are
Okay. So that's really low.<|endoftext|>T. It's really low.<|endoftext|>So the health of your family has been really important to you.<|endoftext|>Like we've already mentioned, it's important for you to be able to participate
So it seems like um Coke is something that you really value in your life and you know we've talked about the different ways that you might be able to incorporate it into your routine.<|endoftext|>T. You know, maybe like, you know it sounds like you
You talked about these the day before, um, you think that this is something that really connects with your personal life.<|endoftext|>A lot of these relate to your being a good parent. I know that you are very busy and have a lot of responsibilities to take care of and everyone has
So, so it seems like you're really fatigued by the idea of trying to... to lose weight.<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like over the weekend you were given this hunkering in your house and it was over when you got down to business.<|endoftext|>I mean the last thing that you really want to do is spend time with your father because his back is also hurting him a little bit and also maybe fear because of...<|endoftext|>A recent trip to Nepal, you had high winds and a strong current in the way that you were carrying the weight.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it
And that can also explain, um, why you're not, you don't feel confident you can, you know, continue to lose the weight.<|endoftext|>It makes you feel like a failure, though, it's not clear whether this is something that will actually happen
T. Um, so that way you can, you know, you can try to control it a little bit more.<|endoftext|>So, again, these are some of the issues that are sort of going to be a challenge for you
T. So it sounds like adjusting around the family is really important to you.<|endoftext|>About one in a three, it's important to you to have both these things<|endoftext|>Okay it is important to you because you are responsible. You are responsible for your family. You are responsible for cooking
T. And right now you kinda feel like that's not happening.<|endoftext|>About a month. So that's a very
Okay, so it's more of a health concern for you, and your daughter, and your son, at this point. And, and your condition as a whole is really scary.<|endoftext|>It feels like a physical toll on your body. And it also sounds like its consequences are really serious. You don't want to be burdened with that.<|endoftext|>It's overwhelming.
T. Yeah. So it sounds like your mom is really, really scared for you.<|endoftext|>So that can have a pretty frightening outcome.<|endoftext|>About a year ago we had a little conversation about counselling, basically. It's a one-hour talk. There are four parts to the
T. Right, so it's just kind of like a scary situation where you know, well let's just say it's scary because you know it's happening right now. It's happening to your loved ones.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like there's a lot of things that go into each step of the way you go about making this meal healthy.<|endoftext|>It sounds like figuring out what the healthier options are is really the priority right now
And, you don't want to go down that road yourself.<|endoftext|>T. On your plate all day. So, you've got the kids and you're taking care of the elderly and the children. That's a lot on your plate.<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like you have a lot of, um, responsibility to care for the family.
It's important that you continue with the, the programs,<|endoftext|>You don't want to spend time being frustrated, you understand you need time for you. And yet you feel trapped in knowing what you want and how to get it but not
So it is pretty important to you then.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like when you are talking about health and being concerned about the weight that you wanna be, you are talking about losing weight. You are concerned about your health and your family.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you are very busy and very busy, you know, working all day on trying to raise kids and maybe cooking meals, plus you are teaching as
You know, it seems like, you know, you have, you have a pretty good idea of what your diet should be, and you're pretty confident
So you've got some pretty scary, maybe even terrifying things going on.<|endoftext|>An analysis of the dietary patterns in your family can help you lose weight. You and your kids.<|endoftext|>A seven or an eight?<|endoftext|>Because they are very strict when it comes to dietary restrictions.<|endoftext|>You didn't mention dietary restrictions when you were seven, but it sounds like because of your busy schedule, that maybe that didn't help you.<|endoftext|>Aah. So your kids are pretty important to you then.<|endoftext|>It's very important to you.<|endoftext|>That must be very frustrating.<|endoftext|>Yeah. Okay. So for you a college is like a very
Because at the end of the day you're really, really motivated to kind of, to kind of make some, to kind of change, not just for yourself but for your family.<|endoftext|>Some of your family members are diabetic...<|endoftext|>I don't mean to insult your physical health by saying I'm overweight. But I am interested in knowing if there is something...<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a lot of competing demands on your time
T. And then the last thing that you see happening is people just getting really frustrated and just having a really hard time maintaining the way that the system is set up.<|endoftext|>Some hopeful signs of life.<|endoftext|>It's been a while? So what happened when you got your daughters
So, the thought of trying to go outside and just walking is kind of, uh... feels like that's not really an option.<|endoftext|>You didn't mention your diet at all<|endoftext|>T. Um... Or maybe I did. You didn't mention your diet at all when your conversation with your
T. Should I change that, or?<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like you are being really hard on yourself.<|endoftext|>Because this is something that we've experienced in your family and it's really important to you.<|endoftext|>From the newspaper:
Um hmm. So this is a little bit of a
You are in a higher state of anxiety and it's kind of concerning, um, your ability to eat healthy but at the same time you've tried some programs in the past that haven't been successful.<|endoftext|>T. Right. So you've sort of fallen in the same type of rabbit hole that you have fallen into.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like there is a lot you need to maybe work on before you get started with this diet. You mentioned also learning how to modify your eating habits.<|endoftext|>It sound like you
So, moving a little bit faster.<|endoftext|>So, we've got a few things going on. Let's talk about what's happening. You had mentioned that you have a lot of...<|endoftext|>Okay, um, so we
A two package is a good idea.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a couple of things motivating you here. One is to feel better about your health and the other is to feel like this is something that's going to be a part of your life long after you've seen it in the past.<|endoftext|>It's been a while. So what we are hearing from you is that you just kind of, uhm, been taking care of yourself and doing some things to kind of manage your weight
T. Then you'll be able just to have diet more often.<|endoftext|>The Kids are a big part of the family.<|endoftext|>It sounds like the difficulty in your family life that you've had is mostly because of the way that your father has struggled with diabetes, and you don't wanna be that burden on your kids.<|endoftext|>You've mentioned several times that your father has struggled with weight as a child and it really kind of runs
You feel a little bit trapped in, um, the fact that you don't have the time, the time to prepare meals, a two or three.<|endoftext|>At this point, the only options available right now are fast food options. You have fast food options at home and you're aware that it's important to you to get this done
And that's why I've been hearing that, um, this is why we came to this and it's why, um, wanting to talk about this is why you've been hearing a lot of things about it from your kids.<|endoftext|>You know throughout our conversations we've talked about how important it is that you make these changes and then hopefully in the future as you continue making those adjustments

T. Right, so that kind of ties into the, um, the choices that you're making about the diet and what you're eating right now.<|endoftext|>A Great Escape is a very pleasant thing? It sounds like there's a lot of things that go into it.<|endoftext|>So let's talk about the good parent. Good parent is a very difficult thing
A 2 or 3<|endoftext|>It's been a while? A while? Ok, so you've been busy all day long. Focusing on caring for your family... Yeah, not so much time for cooking.<|endoftext|>A lot of people don't make time for cooking. Try to make time for cooking meals at home.<|endoftext|>The parents don't allow cooking during the day. They
T. Yea. So when you sit down and you try to do anything physical activity.<|endoftext|>It's difficult because you do know what happens when you go in to the doctor and he tells you to go exercise and then you're on the elliptical and he tells you to go do some other exercise which you
And engage with your work.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you do like to eat sweets and cookies.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds like your daughters have issues with food as well.<|endoftext|>#So it sounds like...I mean if you go out to eat...if you know, if your daughter has...if you're going out to eat at the restaurant, it
T. So it's just like a little frustration from having to put in all of this time just to get through the day.<|endoftext|>It's just a little hopeless. So to speak. There's just a lot of times where you're trapped in the all or nothing feeling.<|endoftext|>A hopeless feeling.<|endoftext|>It's difficult to find the time to even stay in shape and...<|endoftext|>You've got the physical activity in mind but the thought of going out to eat at the restaurant...<|endoftext|>Something
you're really concerned about losing weight.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you do consider yourself a good parent. You and your children are very important to you.<|endoftext|>Yeah. Yea. And yet you still have trouble maintaining
Well, it sounds like you do like to cook and eat some vegetables and some snacks and you haven't mentioned anything about getting some exercise in<|endoftext|>I am a big believer in the power of positive thinking. I think that's not only for you but that it can also be a positive change for your
T. Getting those back out. Something...<|endoftext|>It's hard for you to stay in shape when your children are around. The addition of the exercise makes it even harder.<|endoftext|>Because the kids are also impacted by the weight gain as well.<|endoftext|>You know that can be a factor for you. So...<|endoftext|>A lot of times when you look at these diets you're thinking about trying to lose weight. But, you know, you don't necessarily have that much time for that.<|endoftext|>It's just the convenience. It's much easier
So, he's not really someone in the picture.<|endoftext|>Okay. So your, your experience of being a single mother has been really hard. Mm
it's very important to you<|endoftext|>It's difficult
You're not sure at this point.<|endoftext|>From the peanut butter to the French fries, we've got you covered.<|endoftext|>So that's one reason I'm willing to be a good role model for you. But being a good parent and a good role model are really important things to
and -<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you definitely need something for your lifestyle um, kind of outside the house all the time.<|endoftext|>A lot of your buddies are eating out.<|endoftext|>You may be giving them food all the time. Or
T. You would much rather eat with them.<|endoftext|>All right, well I'm going to just kind of go over what we talked about today. You mentioned you are overweight. So if you are a single mother.<|endoftext|>Okay, so you are a single mother.<|endoftext|>A single mother, okay, really. So you're a single mother. It's very important to you to be a good role model for your teenage daughters.<|endoftext|>So you've been talking about ways to get your daughters involved with the kind of activities that might be helpful
Yea, that's really the only way you can really control that.<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like you have this in your family too, this in your family. You've had some struggles with some of these, uhm, negative experiences with
So you are in the midst of a shift where you are realizing this is a habit that you can't stick with and that you might as well try something new<|endoftext|>A: It's just, it's causing you stress and also making you feel bad about yourself that you haven't been able to stick with it long term.<|endoftext|>
But, so let's see if we match up the times of every day in terms of number of minutes
T. You're really worried<|endoftext|>I'm a teacher and I know that when kids are around...<|endoftext|>A couple of months ago I was teaching cross - generational relationships and I
T. You've tried some exercise.<|endoftext|>A recent study found that teenage pregnancies are actually very common.<|endoftext|>Some of the things we hear you
Because he's been telling you that you need to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables and cut out things that are important to you, um.<|endoftext|>Okay. So when you look at these diets, which usually have a lot of the same...um...to do with exercise or eating in the house and cooking just, it seems like
T. But it sounds like, it might be hard to maintain your long term weight loss when your diet changes.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're also kind of frightened by this diagnosis that you have with pre - diabetes because it sounds like you've experienced this with other members of your family and it's become more of a personal knowing in the past of course it can terrifies you.
So it sounds like these diets are really focused on doing just one thing to the extreme of giving up everything else more helpful to you.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds like you do like, um, you brought up exercise. Um, but you don't seem to really like working out very much.<|endoftext|>It's difficult because you do feel like you have to be constantly focused on doing one thing to the extreme of giving up everything else to focus on your diet.<|endoftext|>It's
Ok, so you have seen some things your family members have had... and you sound like you are pretty... you don't want to go down that path yourself.<|endoftext|>On the one hand, you feel maybe that if you do manage to manage it, you might find that in time there could be some benefits.<|endoftext|>It's important to you.<|endoftext|>You seem pretty... very confident that you can make this change.<|endoftext|>A one or two. That it's going be okay.<|endoftext|>On the other hand, we do know that it's really important to you.<|endoftext|>It's important to you know that, uhmm, you chose to come in because there are certain areas of your life that you really want to focus on. It sounds like you really value being a stay at home mom, which is why you chose
Um so it's a little bit of time constraint. And you know just a little bit of a little bit of the teenage years just [?? ] [?? ] [?? ] [?? ] [?? ]<|endoftext|>Okay, so you mentioned your daughters would be supportive.<|endoftext|>A lot of benefits. So far it seems like it's really important to you.<|endoftext|>The summer
Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>Okay. So this is actually happening. This is actually happening at home.<|endoftext|>About four months ago I found myself in the midst of a fairly intense family gathering. It was actually quite a big thing for me. But it was happening at a time where everyone was preparing meals and having fun. So it really just got in the way of you being able to participate as much as you liked
T. Natural changes, yes<|endoftext|>So, um, what I heard from you today is that you know you have been talking about low - carb diets and they sound like they work. If you are on a low - carb diet, in that you said it sounds
seems overwhelming.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you really value being a good parent, especially in the way that your father is struggling with this.<|endoftext|>T. Yea, you recently found out that the children's health and being a good role model are really important to you.<|endoftext|>You know, your daughter is just kind of, um..So there's just... So you
T. It's really frustrating when you go in to get help and they're not really - they're not really giving you the information that you need or they're not giving you the time
So you've got that pretty important job with the kids and a pretty important social life outside of that. And then the divorce though you know that it's... It's kind of you felt like that it was definitely for the worse and maybe it wasn't as much of a fit for you
7 or 8, depending on which one of those you are...<|endoftext|>Okay. So. Where did you...when you got the diagnosis from the doctor and did you go down...follow the guidelines or...
