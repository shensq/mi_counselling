Okay. So, stress relief is one of the things that you...<|endoftext|>Well, it sounds like you've had some experience with quitting smoking, in the past. And your husband has kind of been a support as well.<|endoftext|>
So, if I could summarize a little bit, what we discussed today is that your husband is a support for you, that sometimes you might feel like you can't, or maybe you're not able to quit smoking because of your husband. And that really frustrates you, because you feel like if he would just get ahold of
T. who's three years old,<|endoftext|>
Yea. It sounds like you're pretty committed to trying this.<|endoftext|>This can get tricky depending on who you're asking. If you're asking a friend to help you cut out a cigarette and, um, maybe you want to cut out a second cigarette and then perhaps, um, try a different route. If you're asking a doctor to prescribe you some nicotine replacement therapy, maybe you want to cut out a second cigarette and maybe try
So, you don't want to have to have to come to the pool again. You want to be a grandmother to him...<|endoftext|>On the one hand, you don't want to be around him because of the health issues, and then on the other hand you're really terrified of what could happen if you try to...<|endoftext|>You know how it can be when you do that.<|endoftext|>So you don't want to be around him.<|endoftext|>It's almost
Yeah, you brought up some really easy stuff that you do at home. So... something that sounds really important to you... to sort of build off of a habit from what we've talked about so far. So.... starting off on your morning...
Okay, so you feel like your smoking is playing a role in your physical health. You are more able to, you said, engage in your activities that are important to you and you therefore see it as an important part of your life.<|endoftext|>So when you're craving a cigarette and you're looking for a different option then you know that you may be looking for a different option than when you're craving the nicotine.<|endoftext|>Okay. Um...so you may be more willing to try and sort of look for a different option.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like, uh, you know, as we discussed in a couple of the past, looking for a different option may be an option. Maybe, uh, finding a way to...and not have to have the cigarettes.<|endoftext|>Mm hm. You mentioned having to get a doctor's help.<|endoftext|>A Congressman is coming up in your life. He may be on the House floor at the same time.
T. Um, and you were actually not sure how it would work with this plan.<|endoftext|>I hear you, you said you're not a doctor. So you don't know what's on the table
T....to help with the cravings, or...<|endoftext|>I know you've been through that before.<|endoftext|>So you've had experience with quitting cold turkey and, um, it didn't work very well for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a
And so it sounds like dealing with it, uh, might be something that would work with this bronchitis and, um, smoking is something you've been thinking about, uh
And you're looking for a different option<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've been smoking for a while and, um, trying to quit multiple times in the past.<|endoftext|>It's been frustrating for you because you really want to be a good parent and grandparent and make sure this healthy behavior is taking place for you. Unfortunately, you're not being able to do that because of things like smoking.<|endoftext|>
- but not interfering as much.<|endoftext|>Well you're concerned about changing this behavior -<|endoftext|>It sounds like: "I want you to know
Ok. So it's been kind of enjoyable to you for a while. But, it's also been kind of a burden.<|endoftext|>It's a burden because it's been kind of socially accepted.
Yeah. And it's kind of... it's kind of... it's been frustrating, in terms of when you try to quit and isn't getting the results that you feel like it was.<|endoftext|>Um, and so
T. And he's very important to you.<|endoftext|>It's been a problem for you personally for a while now. You just have the bronchitis and...<|endoftext|>Okay. So, um, obviously, your husband is a support it sounds like but he's been kind of a hindrance to you in the past. You have had some experiences with smoking as a result of his smoking.<|endoftext|>It's been frustrating for you in the past. And you're feeling like it's really impinging on your relationship here. When you tried to quit
- instead of a drug.<|endoftext|>There are some problems with trying to set these things up. I mean there are some problems with setting
Yeah, the feeling is like having that control factor of, you know, whether this is something you wanna do or not.<|endoftext|>T. That's okay ; do you have your driver's license or something?<|endoftext|>It is important to you.<|endoftext|>It's also important to you....but it's getting in the way of some really important things.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you know that your husband probably helps you with this process, but he
So it's still very important to you.<|endoftext|>It's still very important.<|endoftext|>It's still very important.
And that's where we come up with these, is that, you know that, some of the
it - it didn't work.<|endoftext|>So you tried to quit cold turkey without using replacement therapy.<|endoftext|>So
T. You know, so that's something that you really value, is your control. You said you value your own health, you said you value your own wellbeing.<|endoftext|>I've got you
T. Right, right, so you're concerned that - because you're not, you're not able to, you're seeing the, the side effects
T. You've mentioned before that you hate going swimming and that might be a problem, so perhaps using some sort of nicotine replacement...<|endoftext|>That might be something that would work
T. It's just there.<|endoftext|>It's also important to you to quit.<|endoftext|>A little bit that you were looking for some help, and then you found some help
And you've got to have those cravings just come with the job.<|endoftext|>A lot of times we've talked about the cravings, and kind of how it sort of impacts your life in a lot of areas.<|endoftext|>In this case, you'd like to quit smoking cold turkey or something and abstaining from cigarettes throughout the week. Then you also said that perhaps reducing the number of cigarettes you are smoking each day and week, along with, um, other changes, would
Um, but it was sort of a failure.<|endoftext|>This is um a difficult pill for you to swallow. On one hand you have a
You mentioned that there are some...six or seven...so you have some experience to draw on.<|endoftext|>Right. So there are some things that you could consider...<|endoftext|>In the past I
Ok. And so on one hand, you know when you head out there and sort of pick out what type of aid you want to look up or see if there's anything else
Um, turkey is a big part or maybe a small part in helping you...<|endoftext|>Four years ago I quit smoking and I'm still smoking today. And a little bit recently a friend of mine, who's also a non - smoker told me that, you know,
T. Alright, So over the next...<|endoftext|>T. And you
So you've been smoking for a long time, it sounds like.<|endoftext|>About a week. And it sounds like you're very excited about this change.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like it could work. I
- might be a better fit for you for as well.<|endoftext|>So you're concerned about your health after you stop smoking. You've tried before, and you said that after you stop smoking you may
So, it sounds like your interest is really motivated because, you know, you're hearing, you know, you're seeing some really positive effects of the medication and it sounds like if you can find something that's specifically related to your lifestyle and your work, um, maybe you can, you can maybe take that extra step, that could really help you with this smoking habit that's coming on.<|endoftext|>You're not really having any confidence in the ability to make these changes.<|endoftext|>
And it sounds like you've mentioned you've tried things, you've tried things and nothing really helped. And so you're looking for some ways to possibly improve this relationship in the future.<|endoftext|>It's hard to have that mentality. So you recently quit your cold turkey and you brought in some help, some nicotine replacement products with that. And those really helped you.<|endoftext|>In looking up, I'm thinking
So you're... this is not something that you're ready for.<|endoftext|>It
You're afraid that your attempts might not even get a result.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you've taken the first step. So now you're ready to try to make another change.<|endoftext|>On the one hand, you felt like it
So internally you feel like it's really important for you to care for your grandchild, you know, who's -<|endoftext|>You've been smoking for a very long time. It's been a part of your routine -<|endoftext|>You've taken the first step. But now you're feeling kind of scared about what might next be coming.<|endoftext|>This is coming out of my mouth, but it's pretty important. So, yeah, I'm hearing that, um, you've been smoking way too long.<|endoftext|>I see that
- for you.<|endoftext|>I might just be getting a little greedy.
Yeah. You - You're really starting to care about the health of
Um, so, y'know, we talked about a few ideas, um, to kind of help you with the cravings and - and
T. Um and that stress is definitely something, I mean, you mentioned it's a stressful thing.<|endoftext|>It's a stress relief. Yeah. That's what I'm hearing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're pretty concerned
Seven or eight<|endoftext|>'Cause it's not just a conscious decision. It's a - a hard decision.
Seven or eight.<|endoftext|>It's a hard decision. You have to make it.<|endoftext|>It's a decision. So when you're feeling that way and
T. So that's something that you're ready for.<|endoftext|>A lot of times when you're feeling bad, it's because you're smoking or because you're exercising. So it sounds like you're really kind of frustrated and kind of overwhelmed by the fact that you're having this second hand smoke and that can
T. You mentioned earlier umm, family is very important to you.<|endoftext|>But now it's starting to seem like most of the people who you're seeing around you, at work or...maybe even just on your own, are also people who are also affected by the weight management -<|endoftext|>In making this change.<|endoftext|>T. Sounds like you do have a lot of support from your doctor and that can really help. You also mentioned that you also talked to your daughter about this medication.<|endoftext|>So you do know that
T. Alright, I guess, so then you're starting to see some real adverse effects of your smoking on your health, that's starting to worry you?<|endoftext|>T.
T. And you're not into medication.<|endoftext|>It's just part of your daily routine. But then you also mentioned a medication at the beginning, that the doctor gave you.<|endoftext|>It's not a one two three but it's
T. Um, so it's, really, it's having that sort of control that you feel right in control.<|endoftext|>It's been frustrating, trying to balance work and family, spending time with your grandson during a doctor's visit, with your own health.<|endoftext|>It's important, that you take this slow so you can see your impact on the environment and your family.<|endoftext|>A lot of people don't know you're here
Three or four?<|endoftext|>Like the gum didn't work for you, and then you tried cold turkey without using gum. The gum didn't work. And then you tried nicotine replacement therapy gums<|endoftext|>Aka. They made a lot of sense for you: here you are going to try something that maybe you wouldn't have thought you would
Ok, um, so we talked about a couple of different options today um... to kind of help you with the craving and the other things that you might be interested in doing in addition to the um.. medicine.<|endoftext|>Well, okay. So it sounds like today we're going
You may notice some differences between now and the next time we see you.<|endoftext|>It's hard to keep up with all of these changes. You
- easier for you.<|endoftext|>Alright. So, um, let's look at the numbers. As of, you know, this week, we've seen some pretty steady increases in - in your -<|endoftext|>
It sounds like smoking is an issue that you've thought about, um, for a long time.<|endoftext|>There's been a lot of talk about this and um, it's something that you're
Yeah. You're worried about that.<|endoftext|>So after you talked about how you made the - you tried the nicotine gum.<|endoftext|>You tried
T. - because, you know, you never really felt this before.<|endoftext|>It is very important to you. So, a little push is definitely what you need to do.<|endoftext|>They're not that far. And obviously, swimming helps you
166. Right.<|endoftext|>You've been smoking for a long time.<|endoftext|>It's been a part of your routine.
So you know that even though you've been doing it for a long time, it's been really enjoyable and that's why you choose to quit.<|endoftext|>T. So you could, you know, using that as a excuse, or an excuse, in a way that sort of helps you avoid these cravings even if you haven't experienced them in the past.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've been developing this habit since you were fifteen years old. And it's something that's really helped you in the past, sort of cut back back down on the amount of cigarettes and, uh, maintaining that abstinence even in college.<|endoftext|>A lot of times when you're around your grandson you kind of
So the cold turkey was not really a problem for you at all, but a challenge.<|endoftext|>That's OK. And then feeling out
And you just hate that feeling of failure.<|endoftext|>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, you mentioned that you're not a doctor and that, aside from other health problems, you're not actually
T. Sure, you can, but that's not what you're looking for.<|endoftext|>It sounds like the second [?? ] was pretty scary.<|endoftext|>It's scary for you.
Yeah, sure. It also sounds like the second [?? ] was pretty scary for you because you'd like to cut down or quit smoking but you know [?? ] you're not sure how that would go?<|endoftext|>On the one hand, you'd like to cut down or quit smoking but you're not sure how that would go? And then on the other hand, your confidence would start to build if you did that.<|endoftext|>Maybe there could be benefits to um, um cutting back.<|endoftext|>This is um an option for
So, it sounds like it's been frustrating, trying to understand why it's been so difficult for you in the past or if you haven't been there that is. And it sounds like most recently you're kind of frustrated at the fact that, um, you've been able to quit, you know, without using a gum<|endoftext|>Yeah, you know, as we mentioned, you just can't really have, you
Y'know, and for your health.<|endoftext|>It sounds like starting the day off with a nice little nap and a cigarette -<|endoftext|>This is going to be a good starting point for you.<|endoftext|>You mentioned you tried the gum. Is that the first step?<|endoftext|>You also mentioned that you tried the nicotine gum. Is that the last step
So you have to really commit to it<|endoftext|>On Wednesday night the grand jury in Oakland was not very helpful to
Ok. So you have some experience in this area and, um, you're thinking about your options and sort of your goals for the future and, um, where could this fit in with your goals.<|endoftext|>T. You mentioned that you swim? Is that something you do? So I'm thinking also of the gum. Um, you
So, maintaining control in your life has been a really important value for you.<|endoftext|>T. You mentioned you tried the gum. And you tried the nicotine gum.<|endoftext|>
OK. So the gum was not a pleasant experience for you.<|endoftext|>You know all these things about your family.<|endoftext|>It's pretty important. So it sounds like you have a lot of support from your husband and a lot of, um, dread about this journey that's coming in the form of work and coming to terms with, um, that you're going to be spending time with your grandson.<|endoftext|>
So, yeah, it seems like you have a lot of interest in reading about these things.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like when you tried to quit a couple times in the past, um, you found that the
You don't have a fear of failure, but you do have a lot of things that make you terrified of what might happen.<|endoftext|>It's
T. So, it's just, in your past attempts, that's what you've struggled with and, that's what's preventing you from achieving this goal.<|endoftext|>The recent cold turkey and... And the gum didn't work out for you... with your grandson. So... the cold turkey has sort of been a problem with your family.<|endoftext|>Ok. So now we've heard some pretty scary things. The
58. Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>Okay. So, Mmm hmm. It does sound like you, you've thought a lot about this and, um, you think you can do it, but you
So I guess it's a part of your routine.<|endoftext|>This was kind of a shock to you. What you saw...<|endoftext|>You saw a whole lot of things that you really didn't like. It's ok. It's to have some cravings, you know, for some things. Just having that motivation to keep going and not stop...
188. Right.<|endoftext|>T. Right.<|endoftext|>It's a three or a four.<|endoftext|>It's a three or
T. And sounds like you want to see your grandson again.
So, it sounds like, ideally, you would want to quit smoking and have a plan, something to, uh, follow.<|endoftext|>It is important to you to have some control in your life. You are a large component or maybe a small part in helping this happen. I mean that you are a product of, you are a grandson
T. So you've made some attempts and it sounds like you're very disappointed that you can't seem to break out of the mold of a pack and a half a day.<|endoftext|>So you've tried before but now you're kind of feeling a little bit defeated by the fact that you can actually do this.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your past attempts haven't worked out so well, and it's become apparent that a better plan is something you'd like to try out of the
Um, so it's very important to you<|endoftext|>T. Okay, and we're not gonna leave now. So um, you're gonna keep going, and we're gonna try to do it this way.<|endoftext|>It's been a routine thing for you to do. But as the weeks have gone on, you say
T. And that's...that's where this, this process, coming into your life...
Ok, so you already have a drug...<|endoftext|>On one hand, your confidence is kind of shattered a little bit because you have tried in the past and you hate that feeling of failure again. The feeling of failure is so much more of a thing for you to deal with.<|endoftext|>It's a little bit challenging but also something
166. That's okay.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like the next time you're going to see your grandson you're going
So you smoke around family, you smoke, you know, when you're stressed, when you're kind of just hanging out at home, or when you're kind of just hanging out at home with your friends.<|endoftext|>This is how your?<|endoftext|>More than a pack to a pack and a half a day. At least a pack to a pack and a half a day.
Okay. And so that's something, along with your swimming, it kind of gives you some amount of energy to keep going.<|endoftext|>It sounds like the amount of physical activity you do can be kind of a burden on your health
T. And so, you know, you've tried that before
Okay. So, if you can, if you can find some ways to kind of like manage the withdrawal and the social if it might be something that might work for you, then that might be an option.<|endoftext|>It's troubling. The secondhand smoke can is becoming a social thing for you, something you wouldn't mind just kicking.<|endoftext|>Your grandson getting into trouble seems like something that's far away.<|endoftext|>In the grocery store today.
Yeah. It's going to be quite a shock to you.<|endoftext|>It's scary.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds like in coming up with a plan that involves a little bit more time and not spending as much time
- see if you could come up with a way that -<|endoftext|>You don't seem to be too happy with where things are at with your daughter.<|endoftext|>
Umm it sounds like your husband though is supportive of you wanting to quit smoking.<|endoftext|>I'm hearing some pretty scary things. It sounds like he's not only giving you a pill but could potentially lethal amounts of medication
- what it is you said.<|endoftext|>T. - there are a lot of features, a lot of ways in which this can be a difficult transition with your -<|endoftext|>It's a hard change for everyone to make. - Yeah. It definitely a
You've explored a few options so far.<|endoftext|>Stress is one of the biggest barriers for you in terms of when you get a cold turkey or a glass of water. So it sounds like you really enjoy going swimming and taking care of yourself in the pool, but...<|endoftext|>Ok. So, um, you're concerned about how these cravings will impact your smoking habits moving forward. So Ok, let's just throw that out of the pool and we'll see where we can go from there.<|endoftext|>It sounds like for you, this is something that's been on your mind, perhaps even though you haven't really
So, we talked about a couple of different options that might work for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're really looking forward to quitting this cold turkey and making it a habit. Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>It's
45. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it felt like a failure.<|endoftext|>I'm having some questions. So I know that you're used to thinking
But it also sounds like something that you might want to stop for at some point.<|endoftext|>Well, it sounds like the first step is for you to try
And, it's very important to you...<|endoftext|>It's important to you. So.... So that kind of... This is what I'm hearing.<|endoftext|>A lot has happened in the life of your grandson. We talked about the fact that you have had, um, possibly, experiences with people who really work with you to help you with some of the stress that you've had in
T. You wanna continue on being active and your, your physical fitness is really important to you, and you want to be able to do... things like swim and, and get, you know, to the standards that you want to be at.<|endoftext|>Okay. So I mean
You've tried?<|endoftext|>So, yeah. Um... and so has your daughter.<|endoftext|>And you... so you don't want to be, you know, affecting your grandson negatively, too.<|endoftext|>T. And you don't... your husband's not gonna be around.<|endoftext|>A lot of times when you
So, it's pretty important<|endoftext|>It seems like your confidence is kind of wavering a little bit because you've tried a couple of
T. The withdrawal symptoms are just too much for you to handle.<|endoftext|>Your confidence is kind of shattered a little bit. You're not sure where things are going to go from here.
You said you would not attempt to quit again this time.<|endoftext|>It's just part of the ritual. But I'm hearing that's something you're looking for more from your husband to
T. Okay. So, you're worried about potentially having an impact because you couldn't have a cigarette<|endoftext|>There has been some exciting times in your life lately.
T. and then maybe starting to look at these [?? ] options
So that is -- that's lower than the -<|endoftext|>Okay. So you're into, uh, reducing cigarettes and, um, using a gum<|endoftext|>I'm sorry. I can't quite find the right phrase to fit with what you're saying. I can't quite
And, you said you swim?<|endoftext|>A lot.<|endoftext|>It would be much higher if we were able to cut back on the amount of smoking over time.<|endoftext|>On one hand, you're concerned about how this habit will affect your health in the future.<|endoftext|>I
so it is important for you to stop smoking<|endoftext|>It's scary for you because you really want to be a good parent, a good grandparent
T. Like a good part of your routine.<|endoftext|>Ok, so this is um, it's affecting a lot of parts of your life. Like your physical fitness, you feel like
So you like exercising, you like swimming, you like being physically active and that's what you like to do, and smoking is kind of interfering with that.<|endoftext|>And so - um, you mentioned that you also like physical therapy. And the hand, and - you like to be in your grandson's life. Um and, the hand, and - with the hand, also, you like a good eight hours of physical activity a week. And that's really beneficial to you.<|endoftext|>This is really important to you.<|endoftext|>It's a large chunk of work. So when you get to work having to lay people off, in a way that's
T. And really inspire you -<|endoftext|>It's all in the air now. Let's see what's -<|endoftext|>So you're here today to try and arrange something. So you've got some research on the -
The importance factor doesn't seem to be high for you, but the taste, the -<|endoftext|>The
I guess you're afraid you might be looking for a different option.<|endoftext|>You don't want to replace one addiction with another.<|endoftext|>It's hard to replace one habit with another.<|endoftext|>You want to be healthy. You want to be healthy for a long period of time. You want to be able to engage in your daily life
You also talked about your daughter earlier<|endoftext|>It seems this anxiety that you might be a disease and need to
T. Um, you know, you've been a regular smoker since you were 16, and it's been a part of your life a little bit every day since then.<|endoftext|>So you've been a smoker way too long. You're thinking about quitting.<|endoftext|>Okay let's go back to your confidence. So you've been a smoker
So you, you tried the nicotine gum.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you, you tried the nicotine gum. And it didn't work. And you tried a couple other
T. So you've been thinking about this for a while.<|endoftext|>You've been thinking about this for a while. It's been an issue that has been bothering you in your life. It's something that you've been thinking about.<|endoftext|>Well, a couple of days
47. Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>It does sound like going cold turkey or using the gum are not going to be options for you.<|endoftext|>This isn't something you're interested in. It's more of a
So you've tried it three times.<|endoftext|>You've tried it three times.<|endoftext|>It's a frustrating experience for you. You don't like how it feels to smoke and you don't like how there can be things that prevent you from breathing, from smoking.<|endoftext|>Ok. So right now there are some concerns that your grandson isn't going to be able to swim as well as he used to and you do realize that that can be a very scary thing.<|endoftext|>
T. So, it sounds like it was pretty important to you<|endoftext|>T. It sounds like you're very concerned about
You said you enjoy it.<|endoftext|>Okay. So, let me just throw out a number of numbers: 1. The first
You've been swimming you know, many times a week for a good amount of time...<|endoftext|>This is not really something you'd notice necessarily. But it's something you do think has an impact on your smoking and that you'd like to change.<|endoftext|>It's a really stressful experience for you, especially at this time of year
Maybe, once a week or so.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your husband is a support it sounds like. You know he's tried quitting a number of times and he's been really helpful to you in the past. As far as your personal health goes, he's really got you going.<|endoftext|>Achilles He says the same thing.<|endoftext|>It's the same thing. It's the kind of thing that would
A 3 or a 4<|endoftext|>Ok, so, and you're concerned about relapsing again.<|endoftext|>You afraid about how this is gonna affect your grandchilds health.<|endoftext|>So you're concerned about your grandson's health. And it sounds like your own health.<|endoftext|>On top of that, your grandson's health is very important to you. So you need to take care of him in that way.<|endoftext|>There are a lot of things I don't wanna
Um, but you're not too sure, you've tried before with the gum.<|endoftext|>T. It didn't work out for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your own smoking is kind of a coping mechanism for you, um, to kind of get through certain times in your life. You've tried to quit before. It's been frustrating because you've tried that before.<|endoftext|>So you've tried before.<|endoftext|>It does sound like your husband, uh, has had some experience in the past with a couple
T. And then stress relief for when you do quit.<|endoftext|>Okay. So we talked a lot about um, if you're gonna quit smoking
T. It's something you enjoy doing.<|endoftext|>On a walk through the small hours of the morning, you may see a car pulling up outside and possibly talking to the driver. As you're coming out of the car, you may hear a car radio...<|endoftext|>You may also see a car radio or a hand signal. These are all things that are important to you. But especially you've noticed that the smoking
T. Yeah, you know, that's - I mean, this is really frustrating for you.<|endoftext|>I know you've talked about this before
T. It's gonna be a hard thing.<|endoftext|>This is, um, a difficult pill for you to swallow especially given the economy, you're not
Ok. So, even though you researched a lot of different things on the internet and you like talking to people you know personally and stuff like that, there are some things you kind of feel would work better with quit smoking but also with joining some support groups and getting some treatment through the health care system and getting treatment through the health care bureaucracy are also important
