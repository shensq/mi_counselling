It could affect you more than you know it could affect somebody else.<|endoftext|>More than a few days ago, the doctor sent you to get your - to kind of a physical therapy to deal with your pre - diabetes. And you - got kind of a physical therapy to deal with some of those symptoms.<|endoftext|>There are a few things that are holding you back...<|endoftext|>While you're
Mm hmm. Yeah I can maintain it for as long as you want.<|endoftext|>The following is
Helps you get through certain times in your life.<|endoftext|>Mmm-hmm. So that's pretty important. I mean the, so important for you, it sounds like your success rate is pretty high, um...13 or 14%, even
Okay so, so your starting point was to uhm! sound like there are some options that you might be interested in.<|endoftext|>The last thing you want to happen is to feel bad about yourself.<|endoftext|>You feel like you've let yourself down. Except for when it really comes to the momentous decisions about quitting smoking. Those few moments of how difficult it can be, and how it can be, even, a cinch in your life to kind of reevaluate.<|endoftext|>So a lot of times when you're reading, you're focused on
So it could be a very interesting and busy time.<|endoftext|>So exactly how hard it's going to be to go out to eat with this group, um, is, you know, how, um, how many calories are in it, you know, and...<|endoftext|>There's almost no correlation to how active you are or how much you've done in the past. So if you're really motivated...<|endoftext|>So, based on the, on your experience in the past kind of discouraged, especially those that are, sort of super motivated and -<|endoftext|>It sounds like the, on the one hand, motivated people are generally motivated and want to do it but with the other hand there are some people
So you've heard that it's helpful to alter your schedule. You're looking to meet up with some friends in the near future<|endoftext|>You can't smoke in the car, but you also can't swim or do certain kinds of
T. You are determined to cut back.<|endoftext|>In the past you've tried cold turkey, you tried nicotine replacement therapy gums<|endoftext|>In the past you tried gum. And then you tried to quit cold turkey but found that it didnt seem to work. And then you tried to quit cold turkey again. And there's some success, but the withdrawal or other symptoms
But you have heard of other people, maybe, who have successfully gone on to make these changes.<|endoftext|>There are a lot of different options. If you don't mind me summarizing what we've discussed so far, let me just...I mean obviously looking up and kind
Ok, so, it's more of a confidence issue. But, it sounds like you've tried this before and it hasn't worked and it's something that you
Okay. So it's scary to think that, you know, that's not... that's not true. That you might not be so...<|endoftext|>But when the team at the, uh, Ohio State Health Sciences did a study on diabetes and was sort of
You sound like you are a little overwhelmed with this new diagnosis and where to go....<|endoftext|>So next week we're gonna go down to the cold turkey where we're gonna spend time with your grandson.<|endoftext|>Some turkey would be good. Sounds like a good option. Sounds like a fun family thing.<|endoftext|>Mm-hmm.
T. Yes. So, even though these are very concerning, you're still
So, in some ways, you enjoy smoking as much as you can ; but it's also something that's having some health consequences.<|endoftext|>Okay. So sounds like, pretty, pretty scary, maybe, for you, to think about just quitting. This is very important. It seems like, uh, maybe it's harder to move through that, um, "I have to stop, I have to stop now. "<|endoftext|>Yeah
So you're feeling very overwhelmed with this new diagnosis and where to go...<|endoftext|>A lot of stress relief or kind of a different role model for your kids.<|endoftext|>I am going to try and put this off - for now. It's like a... responsibility here. You know, it seems like a very serious thing that you owe
You failed a little bit...<|endoftext|>Um, but you did it in spite of all of the other stuff that was going on, so...you did
Ok. So the thing is, you don't want to spend time being frustrated with your life and your problems with your smoking
You have the, the confidence to do so.<|endoftext|>So... you're scared. You're nervous that even this medication, that the side effects may interfere with your swimming<|endoftext|>So... some of your, your grandson's anxiety seems to be kind of playing a role in the nervousness
T. If you're able to find distraction during those times, that might be a positive.<|endoftext|>It's important sometimes, as well. For
So there are some benefits to nicotine replacement, but there are also some drawbacks.<|endoftext|>Because of its long half-life, it's possible for the nicotine to cross into your bloodstream and get cut off or slowed down.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have been using for a long time and it's gotten to a point where you can't even swim at night,
Yeah. You are almost trapped in knowing what you want but not knowing how to get there.<|endoftext|>You are a little scared by these results. You've tried the best that you can do and it's not -- it's just not going to work.<|endoftext|>So, again, you held out hope that...a lot of things would work and you're feeling like, kind of disappointment that you can't get there.<|endoftext|>So, you've tried things that, you think have been successful in
It's tough, it's hard to deal with the fact that smoking is a part of your daily routine. So, you don't, you don't really, you
Yeah, well, it sounds like you are missing a little bit of everything.<|endoftext|>It all depends on if you're willing to take the steps, if you're confident. That might be the most important thing for you to do.<|endoftext|>It all depends on if you're willing to commit to it. You know, if you're not committing to it now, you might as well take it easy, or, you might not commit to it in the future.<|endoftext|>You
So you're...you're considering this as an option, and you're considering using this as a bonding experience with your teenage daughter to get into some kind of a higher confidence level.<|endoftext|>So it seems like going
Yeah, so it could be a bonding experience kind of like the bond you guys just went through when you were going through the divorce in the past.<|endoftext|>So, um, at the end of our last meeting, you
So you're really ready to suffer through that.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you've already been through<|endoftext|>I don't wanna say that you're not a fighter, I don't wanna say that you're not a fighter, but we've seen what that can lead you down the road.<|endoftext|>And you've already tried to quit before<|endoftext|>It feels like the past you've been a, a complacent, you know? You don't wanna
T. And um it sounds like you just cravings right now.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your cravings are pretty intense right now. Um, you have...I guess been noticing them for
They want you to be there.<|endoftext|>Like with the bronchitis and with your -<|endoftext|>T. Your grandson being affected with asthma.<|endoftext|>: Yeah. And, um, so it sounds like that's an important part, in your life, is that you're a single mother.<|endoftext|>Okay, so you're saying,
But you do have your husband, you're full time, you're on a vacation, and it's hard to...those things make it very difficult.<|endoftext|>Well everything that we've just talked about, it's pretty important that we address this and make it a routine...<|endoftext|>So you've... been doing a lot of thinking about this, how do you want to incorporate it into your life.<|endoftext|>In terms of...<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've been thinking a lot about this
Will people be okay with me?<|endoftext|>In some ways you feel like a little bit tired and done with smoking all the time. But at the same time you're swimming and really active and really committed -<|endoftext|>In the past you've been able to swim and complete some pretty intense exercise. But this is
T. And, uh, you really, you sound really ready to do this.<|endoftext|>In many ways, you feel like you're ready
And you've tried things that you think they're going to work but they just end up fizzling after awhile.<|endoftext|>So, uh, your kids are really important to you.<|endoftext|>Like, the fact that you have played a
T. It's something that you enjoy, it's easy to do, it's something that you think everyone would be able to do, and you've noticed that, um, people
It sounds like it's been frustrating, trying to quit.<|endoftext|>T. You have tried before. But... um, the first time you tried to quit was - it was maybe eight years ago.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your family history has made you terrified, like you said, about trying to quit. Um,
T. So um, so you just, sort of, when you started taking your meds, you noticed that you had really bad crabbiness.<|endoftext|>T. Right, exactly. And you also talked about wanting to try and quitting cold turkey, but you had
T. And remember the feeling. It's just remembering the feeling.<|endoftext|>The diagnosis was made with the hand and it kind of goes to the heart. Then it kind of goes to the lungs and then eventually the mind. And then they kinda go to the
so, you've been diagnosed with pre - diabetes you don't want to be a burden to your kids. They're like your family.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your, your kids' success is important to you.<|endoftext|>So, um, your team at the research institute is doing some really interesting things. Um, there's a lot of push and pull in terms of different kinds of research that they're doing.<|endoftext|>It's kind of difficult to find things that look like they're focused on you. But they really seem concerned about how important it is to change and improve things.<|endoftext|>T. The importance of being
T. Okay, so, we've talked about, um, you you know, you were a little more, um, on the one hand, you were really frustrated with how this was going and, you know, how it came out
So you really didn't like the fad diets but you were in the know that these fad diets were actually very successful for you?<|endoftext|>Yeah, it sounds like you brought in some interest, that you had some confidence in your ability to do it. But as time went on and more information came out, it didn't seem to be working for you.<|endoftext|>Wonder
You don't want to be hypocritical.<|endoftext|>Um, and then, like, this is important to you, is to practice what you preach.<|endoftext|>It sounds like there are some really important values that you want to hold in
T. Um, so you don't want to kind of go down that road of
Well it sounds like that's something that's really important to you.<|endoftext|>So when you were talking about your new medication versus before, um, just kind of looking for a different option.<|endoftext|>PEOPLE MALE CLIENT: Yeah. MEN'S PARTNER: We work seven days a week
So you really just, you really do have a couple of things that you enjoy doing with your kids.<|endoftext|>You've mentioned swimming and it sounds like your kids have really value for you. But you also talk about the importance of your own health and...<|endoftext|>The last few weeks have been kind of rough for you. Your daughters have sort of been taking a lot of a physical role...<|endoftext|>#Looks like a family you want to be able to
Sure, I can imagine. Um, so it's not, it's not like a one two three. It's like, it's a four. That's kind of typical.<|endoftext|>So, um,
And you really did like the buddy system, it went well with the buddy system, it was fun, you were able to get close to other people and to other times together there...<|endoftext|>Mmhmm. Sounds like it was a pretty important part of your life, really.<|endoftext|>There's a lot going on with this you know you're a
So it would be really convenient to have it all done so that you could spend time with your family.<|endoftext|>So you do need something to deal with this pre - diabetes diagnosis, this diagnosis that you've just been given?<|endoftext|>I don't think it's...it's a diagnosis that you've made and that you've been given is that you want to change.<|endoftext|>So you really do value your time with your
You don't want to be mean and shoot people down when they come into the house and then they're smoking in the future.<|endoftext|>So, um, then one of the things that we discussed was maybe putting a sign up in the front of your house that said " this is not for you. It's for your grandson, but you know he's a different age and needs this "<|endoftext|>Cycle of things: feeding your family, being there for him, being there for your kids.<|endoftext|>Sometimes it's hard to be a good parent when your kids are around. That has been a huge part of how you have been able to parent.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your kids are a big part of why you want to
o it sounds like it's really important to you to be a non smoker<|endoftext|>So as you mentioned you're kind of um...I mean looking
So, it sounds like you really, you've been conscious of the fact that, uh, you're going to have to put in all of this time and effort and that if your kids aren't successful, the reason to quit may be<|endoftext|>Maybe the process of starting the medication was just not worth trying because of the side effects.<|endoftext|>#13. So that whole, you just want to, just for the energy to go up a little bit.<|endoftext|>Alright. So it sounds like your kind of embarassed to know that this
Ok. Well, I think, given that, given that role playing is important to you, setting goals and seeing how, um, how things go, go, go go, go after you
T. And, uh, smoking doesn't have to be something that you feel like, you know, you're dependent on.<|endoftext|>Some things in your life are just... they don't allow you to be, um... They're not allowing you to have this life, or this energy, that you need to have in order to live.<|endoftext|>T. So, um... that
T. So you seem a little...you seem a little...it's scary to think about what you could become<|endoftext|>Because you haven't had any success in the past when trying to quit smoking. You haven't been able to get there. And now it seems like you're really ready to make the change.<|endoftext|>So... you've already been through<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're kind of worried about moving forward. You're a little bit nervous about how it's going to go in this next step.<|endoftext|>Um... So, um... you've mentioned that you've gotten used to the routine maybe, um... but you're kind
So it felt like it was a challenge to your will and your confidence.<|endoftext|>It's another one of those "Will's right and you're wrong...maybe even more than that you're right and you're wrong. It's very powerful and it can sometimes be very frightening to think that you're right and you're wrong. That you're right
T. When you talk about your family and how theyre driving and things that in control, its almost, its, you feel like theyre driving.<|endoftext|>This is how the
They're really important to you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like there are a lot of things going on that are making you worried<|endoftext|>It sounds like although there are some positives, there's some negatives
T. Okay, so, this is a party that you've been planning out all week long.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're feeling guilty. You're feeling like you can't do this. And it's like the past you've tried in the past and you've been kind of frustrated, and you've had some success in the past. You're feeling like this is just not going to work.<|endoftext|>Sometimes
You had issues with your smoking.<|endoftext|>You don't want to replace one addiction with another. In the past it was pretty scary, you abstained a lot and it's not<|endoftext|>So, in terms of health, it's important to you
Yeah. So it sounds like you've had a couple of failures in the past and you're looking for something to make it more sustainable.<|endoftext|>So that's going to be a difficult transition and you've had some success in the past
T. And you seem to be more - motivated this time<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a little
You seem really motivated to me.<|endoftext|>Okay. Um... so in some ways it sounds like you're a little more, um... you know, you feel good about yourself and are proud of yourself for what you've accomplished, even if it's somewhat in a fad -<|endoftext|>T. Right. So being a good parent and grandparent and all that stuff is important to you.<|endoftext|>This
But it will take a little while.<|endoftext|>So... you... Because you have seen the devastating effects, both in terms of your own health and in the future, of your family, it sounds like your confidence is there, that
You want to be able to quit smoking but can't seem to get that confidence with it.<|endoftext|>So, kind of up to date about that is, um, because your grandson recently had some issues with the smoking and so being around him, let alone the health of your grandson is very important.<|endoftext|>There's been a lot of turmoil in your life but you've been able to get through that.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're pretty happy being a single mom. It's something you enjoy doing. But you know,
T. You're concerned about...<|endoftext|>It's really important to you to remember that you brought it up during your swimming
so you're almost scared to go down that road of - to add to the health complications that you've already brought upon yourself.<|endoftext|>But it sounds like you are also, consciously,
yeah, just to remember the feeling.<|endoftext|>I really like talking to you a lot about your life and thinking about what you've
- what is the success rate for -<|endoftext|>Okay. So it not a perfect fit for everybody but for some people
So in part, those are related to being an HIV positive, uhm, uhm.<|endoftext|>T. So moving on from here I think you're really terrified that if you don't make some changes that you're just gonna -<|endoftext|>You'd be in a bad mood, and you'd be
you really care for your family, you want them to see you in a positive light.<|endoftext|>The idea of prioritizing your health and taking steps to prevent pre - diabetes in your life, is very appealing. It sounds like that's what you're looking for<|endoftext|>You know you've tried before but you're not really sure if it works<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have had some success in the past when uh, you're a diabetic, which is great and you're getting better, but you're still a little concerned. As long as you'll be able to avoid it, you can make it a routine.<|endoftext|>☙️Temporary? Like a routine is important to you
T. Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>So, it sounds like you have an idea of what might work for your situation, and that maybe, in your particular case,
T. It could be a bonding experience between you and your son to go do this together.<|endoftext|>The answer of why you would choose to
And, like the, the example you just gave of how, how, how difficult it can be to be to be a good mom, to be a good role model for your kids. And to be honest about that, um, we're going to need to quit our conversation. Because I can tell that you're a little frustrated
- your pre - diabetes, and how that can affect people's lives.<|endoftext|>All right. With that being said I think it's important for you to be - because you don't want to be a burden to other
So you felt it also gave you this other person in your life to care about the impact and see it through your own eyes a little bit. It was really something that was very important to you.<|endoftext|>Ok, so I'm hearing you say that you're a faith - and you believe that, um, in order to get to the higher power,
T. You're a fighter.<|endoftext|>Somehow, someway along the line, we've come to the realization that maybe we need to think about changing some of our behaviors because, you know, we see that children are impacted by their weight.<|endoftext|>It's kind of a 3 or 4. A good parent, but an increase in the importance of this role for you is pretty apparent right now
T. Okay, so, um, you have been gaining some weight in your life, with some concern, that you could be having some negative effects because
That's good. So you've got that, that family history and it sounds like you've kind of seen the effects of that on your family,<|endoftext|>So, um, it sounds like the things that you've been talking about with your family are very salient for you -<|endoftext|>What you were talking
T. It's kind of difficult to kind of be a good grandparent because you want to be able to have that time with your grandson.<|endoftext|>I'm a little nervous about swimming and how it might affect your bronchitis. Maybe you guys will have some more information in this, um an open and honest conversation.<|endoftext|>Um... OK, so, um... I'm hearing that your grandson might be affected with asthma or he might not have life and death decisions made in front of him.<|endoftext|>It sounds like maybe considering making some kind of a health care provider or doctor or something would help you with this. You
T. Um, recently it's been really weighing on your life and your, the importance of your family, that you, what do you value, and your choices in that.<|endoftext|>On the one hand
T....T....and you're not getting that help or that support as you try to
I know, it's hard to find the right balance between kind of eating healthy and eating kind of everything else in the house.<|endoftext|>It sounds like a lot of your concern today is worrying about the weight you're gaining. It's not just something that
T. [?? phrase ]<|endoftext|>It sounds like a very busy time....it's been difficult to get back into those higher gears, you know, with the new addition of the I
T. And this is very important person in your life and you love him dearly and it's important to you that your smoking doesn't affect him and you love him very much<|endoftext|>Um, so it sounds like we've been talking a lot about this. Um, you
T. which you've been struggling with for quite some time.<|endoftext|>All right, so, obviously, some of the things that we've talked about are important. If you don't mind me summarizing, I would like to hear some of the things that you've mentioned: smoking and then being diagnosed
So it's almost become part of who you are.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like there's some controversy going on with the school and the specifically mentioned access that you have to.<|endoftext|>I don't know if it's helping or...if it's hurting you. I mean on one hand it sounds like it's helping but on the other hand it's hurting you.<|endoftext|>There's been a lot of talk
T....overwhelmed with the new -<|endoftext|>In a perfect world, you'd be able to take care of your family...<|endoftext|>There are a lot of things that are important during your life. And then coming up with a plan is one of them.<|endoftext|>The importance of taking care of your family

But it's not just about you
T. Yeah, it's kinda, it's enjoyable to you, it's calming, it's something you can
T. Your grandson sounds like he's almost 13 years old -<|endoftext|>Well good that's a big positive
T. Um... wanting some things and some things that you wouldn't mind just to sort of, maybe to relax.<|endoftext|>Okay. So, you were talking a little bit about what you were going to do today, and thinking about food and your family, and...<|endoftext|>Okay.
T. Um... And you think that it's incredibly serious and it's affects all parts of your life and...<|endoftext|>So it's becoming more apparent that, um... You know, on the one hand, you're concerned about your health and where it might go in sthe future
T. So it sounds like family is a really big factor for you.<|endoftext|>So, you know, just for, you brought up the importance of maintaining your health and your weight. And then having the time to do so, as well as being the best possible example for your children and a good example for how to live a healthy life.<|endoftext|>Ok. So it sounds like that satisfaction level is just kind of shifted because of this new diagnosis. Where before it was like you know, one of the things that was really important to you was having focused care for
T. So as you mentioned you have tried the gum before but it hasn't really worked and you're frustrated. You even though it that you know it's really important to quit smoking but you're a little frustrated, because you know
So you're, you're really ready to quit smoking, I'm sure. But right now, you're in a period of, of doubt whether you should actually stay on it.<|endoftext|>It sounds like a pretty scary thing. A possibility not wanting to quit but feeling that it's a possibility. That could be one way that you could explore that.<|endoftext|>So in part, um, the reasons you want to come in are related to the, uh, disabilities that you've described in your earlier interviews with a disability specialist.<|endoftext|>Okay. I wasn't going to ask you if you were
So that you don't feel like you're restricted just because you don't know where else to go to eat when you're on vacation.<|endoftext|>It sounds like everything you've heard about from your family is kind of related to this, going back to the importance of losing weight on a personal level and taking action to make that a
T.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you are pretty terrified by this. Just hearing the news that you're about to be diagnosed with
T. And I guess that's where, in, in some ways that you feel like you're at a higher risk because your smoking is impacting areas that you enjoy and that you know benefit from.<|endoftext|>Sort of a pattern over time. Like with swimming, you feel like there's some level of risk
so you want to be healthy and...<|endoftext|>T. You want to be healthy and...<|endoftext|>So in some
T. And you know, this is very concerning.<|endoftext|>In order to bring this to your grandson, you need to have him eat it.<|endoftext|>The last thing you want to happen<|endoftext|>The past few weeks have been kind of...Well
Okay. So, in thinking about it and planning out a plan, I noticed that, in the past, you've taken maybe a couple of small steps towards making it a big push and you're noticing that getting a little bit further along, and that's kind of putting your energy into something that you know, something that you know is important for you<|endoftext|>It sounds like spending time with
Um. Yeah. So it sounds like its important to you..<|endoftext|>T. Right, almost, you feel like you've exhausted yourself, like the last kind of push past the four or five minutes.<|endoftext|>T. It's sort of been a pattern and if you get side tracked.<|endoftext|>T. Right, it also sounds
It's frustrating because you are really motivated but you're finding that it's very difficult to keep that motivation and keep it not getting to the better and then you feel like the weight just keeps getting in the way.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're kind of frustrated a little bit because you don't have any control over it.
T. You might even be...<|endoftext|>And it's just...those withdrawal symptoms irritable you. You might even be more, um...not okay
T. It's really not where you wanna be.<|endoftext|>I would like to talk to you a little bit about what we talked about today,
T. Um, but you take your meds and you go shopping for groceries.<|endoftext|>T. So you kinda both go out there and kind of see what's available and kind of try
T....to keep swimming and leading an active lifestyle...<|endoftext|>Somebody you love to be around.<|endoftext|>Mm hmm, so it sounds like you have a very important part in your life and you want...you want to keep doing what you need
T. And then you don't end up finishing them all or...<|endoftext|>I'm wondering if, in addition to your own health, you might be, uh
And you don't have to take the pills every day.<|endoftext|>Okay. So, um, well, it sounds like you, initially your goal was to quit cold turkey, but you're
Mmm, so it's really, it's really noticeable, it's something that's happening with your life, it really takes a toll on you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like one of the things that your doing this time is to exercise. You're kind of considering some healthier options, like some healthier options like uh maybe getting some exercise in your life, maybe like you know using a walker, or uh some new fad diets or whatever, uh<|endoftext|>T. Okay.
T. of what could happen<|endoftext|>Well now it sounds like that's something that. You're swimming a few times a week and that's something that, um, makes it hard to breathe and what that, uh, really makes it really hard to see,
Absolutely, that's...That's a scary though for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you were, maybe somewhat
T. So you're really starting to notice that quality issues or problems with your smoking are coming into your smoking life?<|endoftext|>It sounds like a pretty, really stressful situation. The divorce was already hard on you before the medication. It's been hard to stay away from the medication. It kind of changes everything up.<|endoftext|>So I'd like to talk about how we might need to make some changes in order to better incorporate the new medication into our behaviors. Then I'll also mention that for these short - term changes we are also going explore some other options that might be helpful with respect to, um, the
Looks like a lot of things have changed since you were maybe ten years ago.<|endoftext|>Looks like your
Uh, so, you're really feeling, sort of, almost, almost, a little bit of, almost, trepidatious about the, the idea of trying to quit smoking. Even though, obviously, it's something you want to do, and you are perhaps motivated<|endoftext|>The two major reasons behind this are to improve
T. Um, this is also a concern for you with your grandson.<|endoftext|>So those are all the reasons why I think you would want to start, as far as I can tell from now, considering your health and the medications that are... On the one hand, it feels kind of good to do so, but there's some concern about side affects.<|endoftext|>T. You might have some anxiety
Because you feel bad about yourself.<|endoftext|>You're beginning to feel the effects of the HIV in your life. ( Cliff Sims / BI Video)<|endoftext|>Right. Well it sounds like when you first started though that maybe it was, um, somewhat frustrating, to compare yourself to others in that situation. That you feel bad about yourself that you've been diagnosed with HIV and that you've failed
Ok. But it seems that she did know what was coming and she was a big supporter.<|endoftext|>There's been a lot of, um, talk about the importance of family and being a good parent, and the importance of
Yeah. That's very encouraging.<|endoftext|>You know, you want to be prepared.<|endoftext|>The first thing that you think about when you're out and about your family is how to make it a routine.<|endoftext|>It's kind of the aspects that are important to you like taking your medications. It's kinda the routine.<|endoftext|>We've
So you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed with all this, it's overwhelming, it's hard to stay calm, it's hard to stay focused, it's hard to stay engaged...<|endoftext|>But it sounds like those are all things that your dad, like your other values
T. Which you've really haven't really seen before. Um, so it's, it's kind of, it's been a little bit anxiety causing in the past. So it's something that you're just really conscious of. Um,
So you are realizing this is a reality and it is not just something that you can kind of hide behind.<|endoftext|>If you want to go out back and swim or if you want to go a nice family get-together on the weekends, you might want to bring your own food. Because, as you mentioned, the kids
So your health is really important to you and you want to make sure that you get it.<|endoftext|>Some of the behaviors that you described seem to be quite salient when you're trying to quit smoking. It feels like you may be really motivated and committed to it.<|endoftext|>Cycle of things. But it
Okay. So it seems that reducing gradually would be the best solution for you, as well.<|endoftext|>You've been doing your research on different options and it seems like your main concern today is figuring out how to make it less...<|endoftext|>You need to think
T Before doing it...<|endoftext|>So, you've mentioned a few things that you've had some interest in, recently...<|endoftext|>When, um...when you were at Bryson, I noticed that,
T. And - and if you have, you've got the social - contacts that you'd like to bring -<|endoftext|>So, it sounds like you - it sounds like a really important part of your life. Like, it connects you with your family and it sound like you
You don't have that time.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you kinda feel like the choice was made because of your weight. It was convenient for you.<|endoftext|>There are a lot of things that got in the way of you being successful in the past, you know, just not being able to be as successful as you were.<|endoftext|>It's important to you
So you are feeling a little bit defeated by this whole thing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you are feeling a little bit defeated by this whole thing. And it seems like you have a couple of things motivating you here. You think that this is something that you will definitely need to face in your future. You look into the future and you think that this is a serious thing.<|endoftext|>There's a lot of things going on. I mean, a lot of times when you try and have those kind of conversations with somebody it's really important for them to add on something.<|endoftext|>Somebody to tell you how important it is to change but also understand
T. That's very concerning.<|endoftext|>So... like, you mentioned you had a really rough last few months with your family, that was kind of a difficult transition and you're still
T....or makes it worse.<|endoftext|>So, it sounds like your confidence might be something that we need to focus on
...not too much of a bothersome....<|endoftext|>So for you, at this point, it's really important, it's really important for you to um...to keep going and to keep coming.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it
T. And you don't want to replace one addiction with another.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you might be looking for,
So, reducing your smoking would make your lungs better able to deal with, uh.. less, the stress that you have in the future.<|endoftext|>There's been a lot of turmoil in the workplace this week as well. We've heard a lot of new information, mostly from affected workers. That's good, but there are also some older who are struggling with their smoking. So it sounds like there's
T. Well that, that's a great example for you since, you said you've already cut back a few things in your
Yeah. So you really, you really don't have that time and you really don't have that opportunity and you want to bring those programs or whatever else that might help you in the long run to kind of stay in that kind of adjusted state.<|endoftext|>The Symptoms:
So, you've mentioned several things that have alarmed you about your smoking:<|endoftext|>You haven't mentioned the withdrawal symptoms. They're just sort of...<|endoftext|>There's nothing that would make you think about quitting smoking when you come in here. And so you mentioned things that are important to you, such
T. OK, did you have some concerns.<|endoftext|>Kanye West and all of these other people don't want to be associated or associated with each other. They don't care for each other. It's very important to you.<|endoftext|>There are a lot of competing and lots of, maybe very important, depending on who you ask, a lot of competing. It's not just about money. It's about, you know, the relationships that you will be able to
T. So, um, we talked about how perhaps, um, planning out the quit, um, is important to you. Because you know, smoking can ruin things that you value, like your relationships with your family.<|endoftext|>A couple years ago, your daughter was taking a swim
So you're risking your health by prolonging or not getting engaged in care.<|endoftext|>So you're particularly concerned about your grandson. And you mentioned that he's very active right now.<|endoftext|>You feel that it's important for
So you're seeing a lot of disconnect between the person you see yourself as and you really are and the person you see yourself around you.<|endoftext|>So to start out I want to talk about some of the things that you've been going through and how important it is to change. You're starting to have some real concerns about your weight. You want to lose this extra weight.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like some of these things are interrelated and that it's hard to get them all out one way.<|endoftext|>It's kind of difficult to reach for that weight in a healthy way. But you do. You even said that
And you're considering trying again. But you're nervous about the process and see it as possibly being very difficult.<|endoftext|>In the past, when you tried cold turkey, you had some success, but in the
T. And, but you're not, you smoke for, um, anywhere near the amount that you smoke during normal activities, such as, for example, at work.<|endoftext|>Yeah. The
So you want, you just want, you just want to, you know, put everything in a little better and have more information to be able to make better decisions that will allow you to.<|endoftext|>You spend time with your grandson. It's a bonding experience of sorts. That's what you value and enjoy. You even went as far as to say if I had an activity in the morning and then if I went to bed he would take off at night. That's pretty good that, that would reinforce that feeling and that kind of boost your confidence.
T. So, this is just kind of a, this is just scary for you.<|endoftext|>So you've heard a lot of recomendations but they're just not even reasonable. So...<|endoftext|>You didn't like what you were hearing. And it's been a while? It all seems kind of, um,
T. Yeah, I mean this is kind of an on going conversation kind of like so just for a little bit more information you might want to ask me how, if I can, how I can tell you if its, its a serious condition or not so so serious but its, so its not a walk in the park that you can
Yeah. And you'd be hard pressed not to be able to be able to support him.<|endoftext|>It's...I think you need to find a way to make those switches in your life that, uh, kind of control the, from what you'rent telling me, how you're going to be with your kids when you're not around. Sounds like that, that kind of is a big push in terms of control you.<|endoftext|>Right, exactly
yeah. That's very important ; that's the thing for you.<|endoftext|>You want to be there for your grandson to be able to be a good role model.<|endoftext|>The past few weeks have been kind of a distraction for you. You started planning a quit and preparation and now you're kind of stuck in the pre - quit.<|endoftext|>Somehow the withdrawal is already making you
so it sounds like you are kind of searching for some ways to reverse that process<|endoftext|>It's important to you...<|endoftext|>Okay. So, um
T. And, also, the bronchitis you've noticed in him is something that really terrifies you ; you really don't want to expose him to.<|endoftext|>In the past, you've been smoking for your pleasure, and now you think you'd rather spend your time
But now it seems that you're really serious about this and you think that you can make these changes and that this will last for you forever, this will be a permanent change for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your daughter has an interest in helping to make a change for herself too.<|endoftext|>While your husband is busy taking care
T. And healthy so you can participate in their lives as well<|endoftext|>Some important things happening this week...<|endoftext|>Sort of...is the theme of this week's diet. Maybe vegetables are something you want to look
it sounds like you may be looking for some ways to reduce the amount of diabetes that you have in your life.<|endoftext|>No matter what you do, you're always open to hearing what -<|endoftext|>There are some problems with this - these diets you're following. And the time commitment is like huge. It's like three or four days.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you really value the time
T....a concern of your life. Having those moments with your grandson. Not only is that something you enjoy doing but, you kind of see the stress that that he's placing on your family and yourself too. You know, kind of having that time with your family and maybe even with your grandson. A constant reminder of, " Come on! Just do it! You have so much going on! "<|endoftext|>T. Ok. Um, but... but at the same time, you're concerned about spending time with your grandson...<|endoftext|>T. So it's, it's probably nice to
So you're feeling really motivated to me.<|endoftext|>It's been a while? You haven't really had any experience with the umm - and you saw the impact of the umm - on the umm - a person, a family, a friend?<|endoftext|>T. Right, exactly. Um - that's what this, um, diagnosis's been, and the second hand, uh, has been devastating.<|endoftext|>That's kind of a scary thing. But a cinchy person,
So it sounds like you're afraid, like you've tried quitting before and it hasn't been a success rate, it hasn't been a health or a happiness rate, it's been an 8 or 9.<|endoftext|>Cy
It's like a way to control the amount of this virus that you're getting.<|endoftext|>So basically, I mean, at this point, health is really important to
So it sounds like you wanna be a role model and a role model your kids and your...<|endoftext|>And show them that you're competent and can make these changes to make them healthier and more active.<|endoftext|>T. So you want to be
Yeah, yeah.<|endoftext|>So if you could just get one more thing done in addition to that...<|endoftext|>So it's a lot of things going on. It's a lot of family history and
So...you just want...you're just kind of trapped in a bad mood because you don't have any food in the house to be able to provide<|endoftext|>: It sounds like when you're diagnosed with a pre - diabetes you know, you're really motivated to do something, because you know that
- and see if it's -<|endoftext|>So it sounds like the importance factor for you is really a factor because, you said earlier, you know you really need to have that social support because, when you go out to eat out, you really don't
T. And also, um, the swimming...<|endoftext|>So, um, it
T. It's hard to imagine how you might make the big transition since it's been such a big part of where you're going to school and what you're doing.<|endoftext|>The first issue was that you
So for you, the major factors that seem to be driving you to start smoking again are these are all things that have supposedly worked for other people but not you. And your confidence is kind of shattered a little bit because you've tried
You like to be able to, you know, push your weight back down.<|endoftext|>So, uh, to summarize, um, what we've talked about today, um, is there are some problems with uh, the weight management, in terms of exercise that uh,
So you see yourself, you know, this potential in front of you that you can actually do this.<|endoftext|>So being a good parent is sort of one of the ways that you want to be.<|endoftext|>You seem a little...I mean, just seem a little...you seem a little...you seem a little...you seem...you seem quite...you seem quite...in control
T. You don't want to be a burden to them.<|endoftext|>Okay. You have a lot going on and, depending on people
T. And how important that is to you.<|endoftext|>Okay. So... on one
So, it sounds like you're interested in losing weight.<|endoftext|>Okay. So, um, things just didn't really feel right for you when you tried to lose weight in the past. You were just overweight. That's not what you're looking for<|endoftext|>Today's non-fruitful or non-stressful diet is a popular option in the past but it's also becoming time
T. Seems like making small changes is the key step for you in this process.<|endoftext|>The second and last week of May the team will meet and we'll all go grab a lunch and talk about what we're going to make. This is a fun family thing and you don't want to be mean or shoot people down when their offering you the treats.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you do cherish your grandkids. Grandkids. It sounds like they are an important part of your life and you want them to be a priority.<|endoftext|>It sounds
T....taking your medications.<|endoftext|>So you have a couple of things going on. You're trying to lose weight and you're trying to adopt this new family and really get some people on board.<|endoftext|>Right. So you're on the Board of
So you are looking forward to figuring this out and getting the medication but in the mean while you are on it you are realizing that maybe there are some negatives as well that it could be that you have to take the
Um, and that's really important to you as well.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're not really sure where to go from here. That this is something you can definitely focus on
On the other hand, the nicotine replacement that you're using is pretty strong then.<|endoftext|>T. Right, exactly.<|endoftext|>Sometimes, especially when you're a new swimmer, it's hard to know,'okay, do this,
And then you've had some success in the past. Like you were able to quit in the past.<|endoftext|>Right, exactly. In part, that's because you're a person of faith.<|endoftext|>Okay...so it sounds like all of our focus today is on the negative, taking action, making changes. But there's also something positive, which is really important.<|endoftext|>So then you see the importance of taking action right now. Sounds like that's been a huge factor in your life.
Okay, whatever you do, they're going to be doing the things that you think will best suit your lifestyle and kind of your goals as a role model and a good example -<|endoftext|>So you mentioned celiac. So
T. That you can be there even when other people around you are smoking.<|endoftext|>There are a lot of health concerns that go into making this decision. While there are some benefits, there are also some concerns about your life and your family's health. The other major concerns are about your grandson.<|endoftext|>This is a third grader. So definitely thinking ahead about these decisions is important.<|endoftext|>I think you're pretty terrified because you recently had a conflict with your family over something that was...<|endoftext|>It
It also sounds like something that you value, something that you'd probably be able to work on.<|endoftext|>That you're not the perfect example for them, but you're someone who has been successful at it, in the past.<|endoftext|>So...it sounds like if you saw a happy ending to the idea of quitting smoking, it might seem like you're not being successful as a model for them either. It seems...it's hard
T. So it was more an option then. So playing a sport then it sound like. And as you say, it sounds like now its very important to you then to kinda weight loss then in the past since you really usually have done that<|endoftext|>It sounds like there's been a lot of anxiety recently about things you've done that you're afraid of. So noticing that you've motivated to quit smoking, or that you really felt motivated to do so, maybe. And how this has affected things you
T....so taking care of yourself and taking care of your children is really important.<|endoftext|>Ok, so
So, that's not a support you get from your family.<|endoftext|>So the second [?? ] was kind of a frustrating one. Um, you've had some experience, whether it's with your family or other people in your life, but you haven't had a chance to really see it through the eyes of a physician or a doctor.<|endoftext|>In terms
I mean you do, you do wanna have your energy and your time to be able to do the things that you love to do.<|endoftext|>T. Okay. So, um, if we were going to go
So, but since you've been sober you think that it would be very difficult to maintain.<|endoftext|>This exercise is really difficult but it looks really interesting. So I'm trying to think about ways that maybe it could be
Um - hmm.<|endoftext|>T. So, the, the smoking has definitely been a part of your life for a really long
