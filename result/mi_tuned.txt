Yeah, so you're very concerned about that because you know what that's like, you know it's devastating.<|endoftext|>See also some of the other information below. Also, you mentioned your parents have two teenage daughters.<|endoftext|>This is scary for you. Because you know what smoking can do and how that can affect
So you are taking this very seriously then<|endoftext|>This is something that's very important for you and your family.<|endoftext|>Ok. So you mentioned that your daughter is very
It's scary.<|endoftext|>It's scary for you. It's scary for everyone.<|endoftext|>You want to be the healthiest person in the world.<|endoftext|>Four years ago, your daughter told
So you've tried things that haven't worked and you've experienced what your experiences have been like and you're very concerned about those programs.<|endoftext|>Okay so you know that these diets have been very helpful to you in the past, but the one thing that's most frustrating was trying to lose weight in the past by yourself again when it didn't work out.<|endoftext|>The weird physician behavior at the doctor's office is just kind of making you hesitant
T. That you know, there's a way to mitigate that, in that you have an interest in protecting the health of your grandson, and taking care of him physically.<|endoftext|>Theoretical Framework: The
T. It's not easy, it sounds like.<|endoftext|>##the hard way. But it sounds like you really pride yourself in being somebody who can do what she says she will do.<|endoftext|>You don't want to be that
There's a little more fear along the way.<|endoftext|>Sure. There's a little more fear along the way. I mean, there have always been things that have gotten in the
So that's another reason why you chose this, this particular diet.<|endoftext|>Well we've covered a lot of the important things that you think will help you survive this tough time, but we're going to stop for now. So we'll go ahead and start with you. Um... Okay. Sounds like you are very excited to start, you've heard that you, you know,
It's really frightening for you.<|endoftext|>You sound really scared about trying this weight loss program. You said you have tried it before but it hasn't felt right to you.<|endoftext|>Well that's really scary for you. It's why you chose that. Maybe it's because of some of the things you've experienced
so what I'm hearing you say is that in the past you have had some, you have had some side effects that you didn't really feel like they were bothersome. They were just kinda, they weren't
And just kind of despair.<|endoftext|>You feel like this is a pretty, really important step for you to take to get healthier and lose weight. And this is something that's kind of gaining in importance for you as time has gone on.<|endoftext|>A
T. So that's a big reason why you don't want to be cooking as much.<|endoftext|>T. Ok. So it sounds like you really
So, I mean, sounds like you're really motivated to, you're really determined to, you're determined to stop.<|endoftext|>7. Um, in addition to checking your stress levels, looking at the health of your grandson, and specifically, your own health, there are some things you're really concerned about in addition to your own personal behaviors.<|endoftext|>Yea, well you're concerned with your grandson's health
Ok. So it sounds like you kind of took a lot from that to get healthy enough to be able to...<|endoftext|>Ok. So I'm back and I'm
Also, you went on some type of diet.<|endoftext|>You've been doing it for awhile. But you haven't really gotten that positive boost that you need, that helps you feel better about your health.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're motivated to. You said that two important things, just losing weight and having a better connection with your grandson.<|endoftext|>A new diagnosis of pre
So you think that it is very important to lose weight but you are a little concerned about maintaining and you are concerned that you don't know where to start<|endoftext|>And you started out really really wanting, and really want to try quitting. But you realize that it's really not, really not the right fit for now. You know your technique is not the best fit for now.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like your family history has left you very scared.<|endoftext|>I was also feeling a little bit paralyzed by family history and family is a scary place.<|endoftext|>In times of stress where you're not around your grandson, he gets cold turkey, he has pneumonia.
If it's -<|endoftext|>So we already covered the alarm on your cell phone that you need to change for your
So 10:00 sounds like it's a good time<|endoftext|>So 10:00 sounds like it's a good time<|endoftext|>Ok, so the last thing you're going to try?<|endoftext|>What
T. And then you wanna think about, um, what would be more effective, or what would bebetter for you? Let's say exercise. You wanna get, um, on top of that. So,<|endoftext|>Ok.
So you've seen the devastating effects first hand of what pre diabetes and diabetes could lead to.<|endoftext|>Okay. Sounds like you are pretty terrified that this is something that you can actually feel kind of controlled by.<|endoftext|>An interfaith conversation between you and your family is one of the things that is helping you to really realize this and really do something about it.<|endoftext|>You didn't pick a fight with your family. Okay.<|endoftext|>From what I can tell this is a pretty strict...it's a matter of life
So you've seen your dad<|endoftext|>Yeah, so you're very concerned about that.<|endoftext|>Less so because of the success that you've had with quitting cold turkey, it sounds like.<|endoftext|>An interesting point of view on taking your medications. I noticed that you were very concerned about side effects when you started taking your medications. Maybe you'd
T. But it sounds like you've already been, you've done some research and you have some, you've tried some low - carb diets and they seem to work and then sometimes you're looking for something new<|endoftext|>T. It sounds like you're looking for something a little more drastic than just cutting out the things that are not working.<|endoftext|>Inventory may not be the best
T...is part of your daily routine and kind of, it's kind of bringing you...<|endoftext|>I understand that you were concerned with seeing the reaction from your family and being maybe the one that kind of loses you close ties with them, and
It sounds that camaraderie was really important to you.<|endoftext|>T. Yes. Let's talk about how important it is for you to quit. So... it's very important to you. But there are some drawbacks to the diet that may make it difficult for you.
You kind of anticipating that that it might interfere with your relationships a little bit.<|endoftext|>I'm glad you brought that up because you mentioned both your kids and your grandchildren are very important for you.<|endoftext|>T. And that you have a really strong balance of caring for your family and being there for your family.<|endoftext|>T. And that you are sort of, losing your kids is sort of something you value, too.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like your grandson really motivates you in a lot of ways.<|endoftext|>T. When your children come over.<|endoftext|>So that's a two fold, really. When
T. And you've tried in the past, and you thought you could have some sort of a solution, but it didn't work out.<|endoftext|>Terrible experience to quit. You were irritable and
You care a lot about your grandson.<|endoftext|>You care a lot about your grandchildren.<|endoftext|>We've talked about how some of these relate to your being a good parent. Like if you lead
Ok. So you're eating a lot of fast food...<|endoftext|>A lot of fast food.<|endoftext|>A lot of fast food.<|endoftext|>Yeah. You cook when you're around family. Whereas here you're just eating out.<|endoftext|>The two fast
So the more you can see yourself smoking, the more you can see yourself smoking reducing, kind of, the barriers that you have to trying and quitting smoking. You like to be in control and really set goals and set goals that are really easy on time and really stick. You do um, really enjoy being in control.<|endoftext|>You're afraid that quitting smoking could affect things that you
Yeah. So I was going to ask you if you would like to talk about something. So you mentioned that you like swimming. And you've been active before in sports<|endoftext|>As far as physical activity goes, obviously, although you do spend
And you're not entirely sure how to cut back or quit.<|endoftext|>And it seems like, even if you know how to cut back, you're - you're hesitant about trying to quit.<|endoftext|>It can be very frustrating.<|endoftext|>So you've been taking your medication for two years now and it
You said you tried the nicotine gum.<|endoftext|>An important part of your important plan is to find a way to manage your cravings and cravings without the use of the kind of artificial sweeteners that are sometimes added. You've tried the Nicorette gum but it sounds like it didn't quite
You brought up exercise and healthy eating.<|endoftext|>So, um, we talked about, um...You mentioned that you would like try and fit more exercise into your own life. Um, you know, realize that exercise needs to be incorporated into your life and that incorporating, um...fad diets can be
So you really want to make some changes and maybe some of these complications if they come down because they could potentially lead to diabetes or you.<|endoftext|>Your grandson really motivates you -
T. With your other diet and its impact on your daily life and your eating habits<|endoftext|>It sounds like adherence to a regimen is something that's been a concern for you for a long time<|endoftext|>Okay. So it seems like pretty high up on the food chain you could be.
Yeah, it sounds like you've had some experiences with losing weight before.<|endoftext|>Alright. So, um. That may be why you didn't wanna go in to the program because of the concern with your health.<|endoftext|>Okay. So we know that you have been diagnosed with pre - diabetes. You are very concerned about this
to make sure you're taking your medications in the right amount and and timing<|endoftext|>T. So it kind of puts in a little bit more pressure on the relationship.<|endoftext|>Have your kids taking care of you when you're in the car
T....does, you know, what your diet...<|endoftext|>I know you said you weren't really into being watch - around children...<|endoftext|>So it sounds like, um, your children are impacted by any weight loss
And so then you have a, a good parent who is a, and they support you.<|endoftext|>Well good that's a big positive for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your, uhm! you've seen your father
T. And you've noticed that smoking is a fact that you really, really, want to change.<|endoftext|>You're looking for some help, really.<|endoftext|>T. You're a little bit overwhelmed by this new diagnosis of pre - diabetes.
It sounds like you have had experience with some success in the past and you know have some knowledge of what kinds of programs might be successful in the future.<|endoftext|>The MWC may be coming up for your if you happen to be around this time.<|endoftext|>PHILADELPHIA—A 9 o clock at night is
And it also sounds like your schedule has kind of tightened up around you. There will be less temptation out there, you're less likely to overindulge at night.<|endoftext|>It's kind of, the nights will kind of be over. There will be more nights where you can spend quality time with your kids.<|endoftext|>This weekend the whole family was going
it's kinda like a routine for you, you seem to kind of push yourself around the clock.<|endoftext|>On one hand, you know, you're exhausted, you're thinking about something, you've gotten up in the morning and it's way more important to you to do your morning than to go and smoke. And that's living a double life, working a double life.<|endoftext|>This past weekend a group of teenage girls and teenage boys went to a party at a swimming
Ok, so it's pretty important for you to be a good parent.<|endoftext|>It seems like your daughter, is really struggling with similar issues, and you want to make sure that she's able to be healthy and be there for her.<|endoftext|>Have
T. So you're a single mother.<|endoftext|>A single parent.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're worried or maybe even a little
And so, if, for you at least, knowing that this is something that actually works, then that would really help you, in the long run to, to get you to, to
T. Um, during your lunch break.<|endoftext|>You chose a lower number for that because of the reaction
And, I know you mentioned that you've tried to quit before. Um, we've connected your values with caring for him. But, there's still quite, there's... there's.... there's a lot of things that stand between you and taking care of him or...<|endoftext|>T. And then which one of those is you're... you don't want to talk to him about smoking. You're afraid that talking about your smoking is gonna put him
Um, so you tried to quit cold turkey without using the gum.<|endoftext|>It sounds like it was kind of a frustrating process. Like you
It sounds like it's been frustrating, trying to quit.<|endoftext|>T. So sounds like moving forward you'd really like to cut down or quit smoking, but right now you're just kind of stuck with the idea of just going cold turkey.<|endoftext|>So you really just want to cut down or quit smoking but right
T. And also like the side effects didn't seem to bother you at all, you know they didn't seem to interfere
T. But even when you tried to do it again, it kind of went against your intuition to want to start that kind of a cycle.<|endoftext|>Ok. Um. So
58. Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>T. Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>T. Mmm hmm. So, confidence is there.<|endoftext|>Ok. So, swimming is a very big part of your motivation
Hope.<|endoftext|>You know that one day your body might be healthy enough to be able to go to school.<|endoftext|>I guess that's the kind of hope that you have in mind.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your importance to you is really apparent when you're reading these
You said " health, well "<|endoftext|>The health of your daughter is very important to you. "<|endoftext|>It's very important to you. "<|endoftext|>Um - huh. So you care a lot about
So, it sounds like you're really trying to balance, y'know, your own needs, and maintaining your health, um, not at the expense of helping to perhaps get some of these other things going on, um like -<|endoftext|>Yeah, you have tried nicotine replacement therapy before and it doesn't seem to be having much
You were talking about how sometimes you don't end up finishing things<|endoftext|>I was going to ask you if
T. Yeah just seeing how hard it can be.<|endoftext|>So you, you mentioned things like being overweight and the impact on your family and, um, possibly even your own health.<|endoftext|>Your herpes is something that really motivates you to quit smoking.
support that you get from your parents when you need it.<|endoftext|>It sounds like those relationships are very important to you<|endoftext|>In your family and the - and you're really committed to making sure
In the past, you have tried changing your diet...<|endoftext|>Well that's great. I mean maybe try and you didn't succeed, but you tried to think about it and you did it.<|endoftext|>You did it on your own. You made that decision after consulting with your doctor. You're very confident that this is what's going to work best
So you were missing a little bit of motivation<|endoftext|>It sounds like diabetes is something you've been thinking about a lot and you've tried a lot of different things in the past but you really haven't had much luck in the past<|endoftext|>T. So when you kind of came out of that you were a little bit disappointed in your results. Uh, but you're really ready now to kind of turn that around a little bit. You're ready to try some different things<|endoftext|>Okay, great. Um, but doing a lot of these social situations with your grandson is one of those things that really instills that drive to
It's important to you -<|endoftext|>You're scared. This is scary stuff. Try to take action now.<|endoftext|>T. It's important to you to take action now because you want to live a long life.<|endoftext|>: Okay. So you're saying it's important
Right! And you think that, um, that, it's frustrating that you can't seem to break out of the mold and, um, things in the lifestyle of your parents seem to hold you back.<|endoftext|>In the past I've talked about the importance of quitting smoking and some of the reasons why you might not be as successful as you were hoping...<|endoftext|>So if you do end up quitting smoking you'll be able to make a change, and you'll have a better chance at being successful
So it sounds like if you can find a way to manage your pre - diabetes right now, smoking would be one of the few things that might be able to help you --<|endoftext|>I chose a pretty high number because it was kind of a con - it's higher than zero on the scale where you want to be.<|endoftext|>It sounds like it's pretty important to you.<|endoftext|>This coming on the heels of the divorce
hings might be different. But overall, it sounds like the same thing as what you were saying, getting side effects from taking both
And, you're kinda seeing how this affects your daughters health in a negative way.<|endoftext|>Well good that's a big positive for you. That's a big positive for your daughters health. And by good I mean kind of responsible, healthy, responsible, um...<|endoftext|>The other thing that's very important to you is that you're confident that you can change your eating habits because these behaviors help
yeah, yeah. There's something about these diets that seem really out of control to you.<|endoftext|>The other day I was going to ask you something, you had no idea where to start. I was going to ask you, you had an eight, okay, you had a good eight, so you are generally in for eight, eight, eight, eight<|endoftext|>So it kind of [?? ] you were feeling a little
Compared to -<|endoftext|>You mentioned a couple of things that you find really valuable, like your health, your energy.<|endoftext|>
Yeah. But it sounds like that's where, you know, you have the most frustration right now.<|endoftext|>In this week's issue of the newspaper, we have a
Yeah. They don't understand why you need to take care of yourself so much.<|endoftext|>The holidays are over. Let's go to the Christmas tree and...<|endoftext|>In the car the next time you're going to drive.<|endoftext|>Oh ok. So, let's go back to your confidence. So you said that you had a pleasant experience with the bronchitis and that you
So, it sounds like you've attempted in the past when you tried a weight loss program, it just hasn't worked out.<|endoftext|>It's
T. That's a big concern for you.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you are concerned about your weight gain since your daughter was diagnosed with pre - diabetes. And you want to make sure that you don't go back in to the same situation that you were in with your.<|endoftext|>Okay, so you know that the addition of some weight could possibly have an adverse effect on your
From experiencing what your father's gone through, to having the son you wish you could, to having your family, to having the grandson you wish you could. And you also mentioned that your grandson..<|endoftext|>Your grandson..<|endoftext|>$Your grandson..like the thought of having smoking in your life is something you like to think of.<|endoftext|>The thought of having cigarettes
T. Yea it seems like even if he were really helpful and then he'd like to stick with it but given that he is not really committed to helping you I'm sure that would be
Sounds like you really do want to make a change to reverse that pattern.<|endoftext|>The past week has kind of been kind of a wake up call for you. Your husband has kind of recently gone on a new diet, which he'd never touched before. And you're kind of wondering, "Do I need to start doing some things to reverse
Yeah, Yeah. See through their eyes a little bit.<|endoftext|>Ok. So, so you came in here to
Mm - hm. You know you feel like it's holding you back.<|endoftext|>You had mentioned that you swim at the swimming pool, maybe in addition to your regular physical activity.<|endoftext|>This past weekend your grandson was diagnosed with pre - diabetes. The
So in the past you've had, you know, people telling you that you're not good and that you shouldn't be, uh...you're focusing on yourself and taking care of yourself.<|endoftext|>The first thing that you noticed after quitting your smoking was that your bronchitis had almost
You gotta work on that.<|endoftext|>T. So it's important for you to eat healthy when you're here. That's why you're coming in.<|endoftext|>This is a hard time for you right now. A lot of death and a lot of, um, loss and, uh, tendency toward spirituality. So losing family is very important to you.<|endoftext|>In other parts of the globe, people are varying degrees of, uh, spiritual
T. Yes that, it was very important for you to take your meds.<|endoftext|>I would like to ask you some questions and see if you have any answers. So basically you would like to know how we are doing with the situation. And you said you are a new mother and you have recently had a pre - diabetes diagnosis. And you kind of made it seem
T. Um, but... So there's also this... It's like a daily ritual. So that's also something that you adhere to.
Yeah ; it sounds like that is a big reason why you don't want to be around weight watchers, or, in general.<|endoftext|>With both your kids being very
T. - uh, being around your grandson. And especially since he has asthma.<|endoftext|>It sounds like it's frightening you now..<|endoftext|>In terms of nicotine replacement therapies, is there one that you know of or is there
Okay. So it sounds like you're afraid that telling him that you're giving up...<|endoftext|>You know, that's probably going to make it really difficult and
you feel like your not successful but your not where you want to be.<|endoftext|>So you've had some success in the past and now you want to try to take it further this time.<|endoftext|>T. Just need to find out where you can improve your diet.<|endoftext|>You said you were at a point of where you were 100% adherent. Now you're at a point of where you're not sure how sustainable a diet that you might have to maintain<|endoftext|>Okay you said you were at.<|endoftext|>At this point it seems like adherence is a problem because you said you weren't really adherent. Maybe you're really motivated to lose weight by the Nicorette
Okay. So having a positive attitude and being confident about your abilities to do so, is really important to you.<|endoftext|>Okay, well good luck getting through this.<|endoftext|>I'm glad to hear that you're being, you know, looked
T. So, it sounds like if we're going to kind of look into that option, we're going to need a little bit of time.<|endoftext|>: When you went to grocery shopping for groceries on Sunday, did you have any of those um, thought, uh, push back like you might need to get back from there.<|endoftext|>You were very
T. As a result of the diabetes you would not be able to have the weight that you - you want to.<|endoftext|>Aah. So that's another possibility that you're thinking of.<|endoftext|>In the past I've said that you
T. Again, it's a little bit too much at once for your tastes.<|endoftext|>A good eight or eight, eight, eight, eight is a good eight or eight<|endoftext|>So we have really good eight or eight relationships with your eight<|endoftext|>Yes that's very important to you. This is saving lives. So for you eight or eight is really important.<|endoftext|>THEY'RE PARENTS PLAYING
And you tried a nicotine replacement therapy gums<|endoftext|>This is not something you would want to try again. It might be too painful.<|endoftext|>All right. Let
T. And the higher you go, the more the sooner you're gonna see results, hopefully.<|endoftext|>T. You have already seen some benefits, so you're thinking of these healthier options. This is definitely not the dieting scare mongering that you were, it sounds like.<|endoftext|>Ok. So when you did the diets before and you really stick with it, you see some benefits, you know.<|endoftext|>...but you know the time is limited and you have to rely on adherence at this point.<|endoftext|>The schedule is a little bit limiting.<|endoftext|>A lot of times a week
It sounds like you've been looking for, for something different.<|endoftext|>You want something more sustainable for your lifestyle
and um so kind of the structure of your day sounds like almost a routine for you both your physical activity.<|endoftext|>So you know the busy schedule of 10:00 on weekdays and then a 5:15 at night.<|endoftext|>Your full time schedule sounds like it's pretty in the picture.<|endoftext|>So you are very busy and so maybe it makes sense that you would wanna
OK, so there have been multiple quit attempts...<|endoftext|>I mean there have been several quit attempts but you
so its really important to you to be able to quit smoking<|endoftext|>You feel like you could make a difference.<|endoftext|>#In making a difference? Make a difference and getting this nicotine fix is part of that.<|endoftext|>It's like if you do this, you really will. And if you don't do this, you just might as well be quitting or not doing this.<|endoftext|>There's definitely benefits of going cold turkey, quitting smoking being a non smoker. But there are also side effects. Like how the cravings come back. So you fear gum is gonna put you at greater risk.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like nicotine replacement therapy can be helpful to you.<|endoftext|>A three or four pack.<|endoftext|>So you
So you see, um that a lot of fear, that you might be able to get yourself to be successful...<|endoftext|>So, a 4 or 5<|endoftext|>So, if you see a 4 or 5, you're pretty high up on that scale.<|endoftext|>The weather changes that may happen if you choose to start your cigar smoking again.<|endoftext|>The pleasant weather, it sounds like, might have something to do with how your family is a, a
Yeah feeling like you're not in control.<|endoftext|>I know that you've tried nicotine before but never really had that much success with it.<|endoftext|>A grandmotherly kind of thing. A little too pushy
T. And keep going<|endoftext|>You said you had never tried a nicotine replacement
So they like the stuff, but they don't, yeah they don't want to eat all the junk food<|endoftext|>Ok<|endoftext|>In a lot of ways you feel like your children are impacted by your eating, and that's most of the time.<|endoftext|>It sounds like that, you know, doing that is really what forces you to eat healthy.<|endoftext|>A lot of times when you are confident that you can find something to replace it, you know, it doesn't seem like that's the best option.<|endoftext|>On the
It sounds like you're just kind of embarassed to admit that you've been smoking for so long.<|endoftext|>You said you swim?<|endoftext|>This is really important for you, and you said you swim because you're an eight<|endoftext|>It's really important for your personal health and your ability to be an eight or a nine, for your job, and for your grandson.<|endoftext|>T. So being able to be there and healthy so that your grandson can also be there...<|endoftext|>
but yeah it sounds like even with all the extra time that you have taken for yourself almost it's kind of taken its toll on your health.<|endoftext|>T. That can be really a scary thing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a pretty active social life.<|endoftext|>You're a teacher. You're just getting back into the swing of things.
So it's like a daily routine.<|endoftext|>About a week. So you had some friends who were kind of health conscious and gave you some healthy options...<|endoftext|>Right. So you're kind of taking them to heart and asking them to kind of follow your example and to kind of incorporate some of the things...<|endoftext|>T....you know
T. Alright. So you said you would not make any food changes.<|endoftext|>Four teenagers. Eightish, eightish.<|endoftext|>It can be a lonely experience, especially since your family is a very
T. It makes you feel really defeated and pretty defeated when you see what have happen to other people.<|endoftext|>books.google.com<|endoftext|>In the past place we've seen a couple of really low - carb diets and low - sugar diets that seem easy on the outside but they usually require weeks or months of follow up care. Maybe just stick with what you've got for a while.<|endoftext|>You've seen the
T. It sounds like you've gained some weight since you started the medication. Let's just throw that out there if you can. But it sounds like
A good eight?<|endoftext|>An eight?<|endoftext|>So you are saying that eight is very important to you...to complete your eightieth birthday...to be able to swim as long as you want to and to be around your grandson more...<|endoftext|>You want to be around him...to be there
And you went to Weight Watchers for a while and now you consider yourself a pretty disciplined person.<|endoftext|>So you are really committed to losing weight and you're looking for some ways to - that goal.<|endoftext|>It's kind of scary for you right
A 3 or a 4<|endoftext|>Okay, so that's pretty low.<|endoftext|>In some ways you are kind of sacrificing a lot to give to your children.<|endoftext|>You're sacrificing a lot for your children in a lot of ways.<|endoftext|>No matter how hard it is now, a lot of times I think you feel like you [?? ] are sacrificing, you don't want to think about yourself as much. You want to be a good parent.<|endoftext|>
And, [?? ] stress re - lower if you don't [?? ] smoking. Um - huh.<|endoftext|>Sometimes, you're busy and have a lot of responsibilities around the house to take care of, but also, coming up with food is a lot of things that just end
T. And you're kind of dreading trying to do that again because it seems to have the opposite effect.<|endoftext|>So you've mentioned that you've had experiences with diabetes, throughout your life, and you're know that those experiences have really effected you, and it's impacted on how you see yourself as a person,
So, this past attempt to quit was frustrating because you weren't able to get yourself to actually quit.<|endoftext|>Aerdus: Aerdus are hard to quit. Ok, but this past attempt succeeded in getting you to actually quit.<|endoftext|>You're concerned because your grandson has asthma and that you don't want to put yourself down the same way, either. You want to make sure you take your medications and block that route.<|endoftext|>It sounds like he's important to you. It's important to be around him<|endoftext|>
T. You have to start making those changes<|endoftext|>T. And you feel like you have to start making those
Okay. You mentioned some of the things that you've tried in the past are just the cold turkey and...<|endoftext|>Okay. So the regimen that you were on before seems like it might sort of hasn't had the results...<|endoftext|>So it's not something that's going to last forever.<|endoftext|>What's concerning you now
You want to learn how to use it, but you're still, you don't want to go to the point
You step up and kinda fight off<|endoftext|>Your father would be proud.<|endoftext|>In making these changes you want to make, even though they're not necessarily going
So adjusting something to just take up the extra time you have -<|endoftext|>Uh huh. So this is really starting to worry you.<|endoftext|>A little concerned. sorry.<|endoftext|>
Yah. And you mentioned a couple of things that you really like the importance of losing weight.<|endoftext|>So you're concerned that taking your meds and getting themchy will, um, make you prone
Umm talking about your health and wanting to stay active.<|endoftext|>T. Being able to do the things you enjoy doing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have
You'll go to the beginning and you'll go to the end.<|endoftext|>So you've got a pretty hopeful look. You feel like you've already crossed another turn.<|endoftext|>When you think of hope and then you're like, " OK, " not doing so well
And it's almost like you've already gone off the path a little bit<|endoftext|>Okay, so we've talked about why you're, um, you're here, and you're here...<|endoftext|>The children are really important to you.<|endoftext|>So you want to be there for them.<|endoftext|>So you want to be there for them when they
So it's still there, it's just getting worse.<|endoftext|>So you mentioned things like being short of breath.<|endoftext|>There have been some really good values throughout your life. Your a single parent. Health. You drive. You took a lot of
T. Okay. So, um, just kind of noticing that you have this pre - diabetes diagnosis and that it's sort of triggered by a
So it sounds like you have you know been talking a lot about making healthier choices and then specifically you mentioned looking at the menu at fast food restaurants<|endoftext|>T. So your goal is to kind of like the on the menu at the fast food restaurants<|endoftext|>T. Um, but it sounds like one of the most daunting areas for you is
It sounds like you do enjoy being around your children.<|endoftext|>In today's update we're going to talk about how we go about cook at home, you know, starting your cooking as a part of your daily routine.<|endoftext|>In today's update we're going to talk about you know. You are not really showing any interest in quitting smoking as your priority right now, but some of those
Hope for the future is actually higher than the number one concern<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like quitting smoking is actually a possibility for you as an option to reduce your stress even if you are in a relationship
Ok so it's a pretty important...<|endoftext|>A goal is a great value for you and your family.<|endoftext|>T. That's something that's very dear to you.<|endoftext|>Okay so your family is very important to you and you don't want to not be around them because of your smoking. It's affecting their swimming, their health, their personal lives.<|endoftext|>In a lot of ways your family is an inspiration for your, you're an inspiration for your daughters
So very much of what we've talked about is that you've been, uhm... you've been diagnosed with this and you're trying to figure out what ways to get healthier and lose weight.<|endoftext|>The word for this is " blade "<|endoftext|>Okay. The other word is " blockade "<|endoftext|>Ok. So the last thing I want to say is that I don't want to... You want to
And, be able to...<|endoftext|>T And eat healthy when you're children are around.<|endoftext|>So, having,
T. If there's one side effect to the HIV medication, it's that it makes you dizzy.<|endoftext|>Okay
And it sounds like you really, like you really value being a mom and taking care of yourself and being able to be there for your children<|endoftext|>I've been kind of seeing this through Mom and my own experience of having a lot of weight gain, and you
So, you almost feel like smoking is sort of a physical addiction.<|endoftext|>Ok so it sounds like your kind of habit to do this are kinda like the side effects of, of nicotine like you said with like the stress on your nerves, you're like really tired and have a hard time.<|endoftext|>Ok so those may be connected to having a really strong negative - a negative energy level which may be a result of, not smoking<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your kind of
OK well ok so your eating out a lot.<|endoftext|>A lot.<|endoftext|>Okay, so you mentioned that you had like the side effect of the of the puss around the nose, but it sounds like you weren't really, um, you were irritable and that irritated other people around you as well.<|endoftext|>Four friends of
Right, and it sounds like, and keeping your health in mind, keeping your daughter healthy, um, is really important to you<|endoftext|>You told me that you usually go to the doctor's when you have pre - diabetes because of some of the complications that can come with diabetes -<|endoftext|>A: They
T. Who you've mentioned are, are supportive and that's really beneficial to you.<|endoftext|>The importance factor is already there for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you remember it sort of relates to your starting to taking medications.<|endoftext|>Um hm. It seems like you've been taking medication since you
That would reinforce the feeling of being a good parent to be a good example to her.<|endoftext|>From left to right, from the top to bottom, I noticed that you were in pretty bad health. You were hospitalized for your diagnosis of pre - diabetes.<|endoftext|>If you were
...or maybe you can try but it may not be as cut and dry<|endoftext|>An entertaining and engaging experience. You went to a couple of family and then went out to dinner. It was very
Yeah. It's okay. Umm... it sounds like, there's been times where you've looked at maybe different
T. That you have tried to cut back in the past, but you find yourself particularly motivated, now that there are some Uh, really compelling reasons to change your behavior. But it's not that easy to do.<|endoftext|>And you're kind of afraid that, ah, going down that road, um, you may end up like the other people you were talking about, you know, gum was a big one that
So, it sounds like your, your confidence level, or lack of competence
ok, your faith has really, really been a positive point in your life.<|endoftext|>I'm sorry. I'm putting it on the back burner.<|endoftext|>Have you noticed any changes since you started? Will you be able to participate full time since you started?<|endoftext|>T. Yes. So it's important to you that we don't lose
T. Set your alarm on your cell phone so you have that as a back up reminder<|endoftext|>It sounds like that's something you really
And it's something that you've thought about a lot, and it's something that's been a problem.<|endoftext|>This is from my past experiences of trying different diets. That experience really stuck out to me, because you were not able to get to the point where you felt like you could lose weight but were able to maintain that weight
Yeah, we're not doing that. You know, just don't, you don't know, what fast food stands for.<|endoftext|>Your goal here. You're here to try and figure out a plan and do what
so that's why it's important for you to take your medications<|endoftext|>In the past I have tried to lose weight and it just hasn't
But it also helps you kind of get through, like you said, what's happening.<|endoftext|>It's kind of
So that's a positive...<|endoftext|>In terms of spending time with your family, spending time with your grandson.<|endoftext|>So that's the positive for you.<|endoftext|>So for you, someone of your family, is what would make this possible.<|endoftext|>Um so you mentioned your family, being there, being around, being a good spouse. Ok, you know having a good relationship with your husband also, and also being in the process of getting your daughters also.<|endoftext|>
So it might fluctuate<|endoftext|>Okay. So you've got your family history and you're a single parent.<|endoftext|>The correlation here is maybe the most impressive thing ever.<|endoftext|>So you've got your family history down and you're a mother. But you also have an impressive job.<|endoftext|>It's kind of
Three or four.<|endoftext|>#T. So you, you mean that you know, you've tried things that haven't worked<|endoftext|>T. So you're saying that you tried, say, cold turkey and it just hasn't worked for you.<|endoftext|>Oh yeah. So you're really fearful of trying to do that again. You tried the
you've heard of other people, maybe you've seen the kind of results, you've seen what happens and what can happen.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you really value being a mom, and having that support.<|endoftext|>An 8- or 9,
Right. And when you do smoke, you kinda have that feeling of being powerless.<|endoftext|>The house has a big door right outside the front with the little sliding door that it is.<|endoftext|>In terms of the sound it makes when you're smoking, it's kinda like a bellwether, or a whirling dervish, it's like
Okay so the program you've tried, what I'm going to say is the following<|endoftext|>It sound like you really value health and you value being active. So you will try this program but you'd like to find out more about the healthy food options.<|endoftext|>The reasons are pretty overwhelming to start. Sounds like you've already been motivated there.<|endoftext|>
He's not somebody that you see, that you're worried about.<|endoftext|>There's been a couple of health scares recently, uh... that have me very concerned. First of all,
Your father is overweight.<|endoftext|>Okay. And your mom is overweight. And your sister also is overweight.<|endoftext|>That's a lot of information to absorb and a lot to take in. And it
T. And she told you that um, she would be able to give you, um, dietary guidelines for um, eating out more<|endoftext|>T. Yea, like what type of foods and bring you snacks and bring you snacks throughout the day.<|endoftext|>An
and your effectiveness,<|endoftext|>Okay so your looking for some ways to manage the pre - diabetes right now...<|endoftext|>Ok so your kind of concerned about losing weight right now, although it's not what you're concerned about right now.
T. Being able to focus on yourself and focus on your health.<|endoftext|>It's very important to you. And it seems like right at this point there's some chance you could actually hold out the hand of a 10 or so.<|endoftext|>2: Yeah. That's very important to you.<|endoftext|>The energy level at this point is sustainable for you and your family.<|endoftext|>T. You feel like you actually need to get it in your family.<|endoftext|>A
It also sounds like spending time with your grandson is something you enjoy doing.<|endoftext|>Oh wow, so you're really busy and have a lot of responsibilities to take care of. And um it sounds like you really, um you're really running around and sort of... Feeling like ready to do some
You're feeling very defeated right now.<|endoftext|>Okay, so you've quit 3 times in the past. And it's really frustrating, because you're trying to quit and you're not getting any results.<|endoftext|>A new control has been put in place over your car.<|endoftext|>You should change your routine now. It's affected by your medications, and that might affect how well
Um, okay. So just to to make sure I'm, I'm remembering you mentioned that you want to be a good parent. I was wondering if you had, you didn't want to be hypocritical to your kids about your HIV and that you were a good role model for your kids.<|endoftext|>This is a really great example of how, I guess, you know, being successful in the past has really helped you with, uh, your family values and preventing, uh, uh, being a good parent.<|endoftext|>Because you said your daughter told you that smoking was a coping mechanism for her, and now her concern about
Okay. So it sound like you've had some pretty severe side effects with other medications in the past<|endoftext|>I remember you said you could only eat special things...<|endoftext|>It sounds like you know, you were concerned about the taste of the gum.
Alright. So, from what I can tell, it sounds like there's a couple of really strong things...<|endoftext|>You're looking to do something that would make
But it sounds like the nicotine replacement therapy isn't something you're interested in at this point.<|endoftext|>Okay, great. So we have today, your grandson.. uh, you said your grandson.. uh, was diagnosed with pre - diabetes, and he's...has kind of scared you a little bit about what's to come<|endoftext|>So you have your own health and being a umm, watching your family, and making sure you take care of
So, part of what makes this tolerable is that you are not, you know, you are not eating out a lot of, you know, fast food.<|endoftext|>Ok. So we established that
T. You know, just a little more information and maybe identifying that maybe this is unhealthy because you want to cook.<|endoftext|>T. Right, right. So I mean, is it because you're stressed out, or is it because you have the kids?<|endoftext|>The kids are at an important part of this, and I mean, it sounds like they're an integral part of this.<|endoftext|>T. You want to spend time with them...<|endoftext|>It sounds like your kids are really important
you're worried about diabetes?<|endoftext|>Yea, so there's also your family, being it being a role model for your kids, and trying to figure out ways to kind of be healthy with your fast food options are really important things.<|endoftext|>T. Your school is really important to you.<|endoftext|>There are definitely benefits to the exercise, but also the factors that might make it challenging to continue being a healthy individual...<|endoftext|>A good parent is important to you and you're starting to think about ways that your kids might be able to benefit from. Perhaps incorporating some exercise into your schedule
So, you enjoy it! You're afraid that it's gonna make your grandson sick!<|endoftext|>Theoretically, the higher, the higher and the higher, uhm, until you get to about eight or nine.<|endoftext|>Okay. So there's a genetic component to smoking as well.<|endoftext|>T. So why start something...<|endoftext|>A vegetable garden at home is a much more sustainable option.<|endoftext|>Healing a vegetable garden is important
T. Right, right, so just to - just to summarize, you are looking for, you know, some options to either individually or as a combination,<|endoftext|>What's been on your mind and what's worked best for you so far.<|endoftext|>So far
T. And seeing how, you know, you already, see, like, what might work the best for you?<|endoftext|>A few days ago we were talking about different medication options that might be good options for you. Specifically, you had mentioned, you know, you cant get gum because of the smell and also, you cant get nicotine and that, you cant get the medications because of the scents that are usually responsible for people smoking.<|endoftext|>The gum is not an option.<|endoftext|>T. The gum is not an option for you.<|endoftext|>Two weeks
So you value being active.<|endoftext|>On the one hand, prediabetes is a scary thing. It's scary to think that you could have a genetic component
T. A good one.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you really, um, you enjoy being
Yeah, so it's pretty integral to you.<|endoftext|>It's been up for a couple days. my family is coming to the restaurant to eat.<|endoftext|>In an effort to get you to stay away from the children.<|endoftext|>With the recent viral load gain that has put a strain on the family<|endoftext|>Have you tried to lose weight before? Were you successful with that?<|endoftext|>So you've mentioned that everything you've done in the past has kind of failed
Some other things that you might have added, like maybe anticipating or preparing ahead of time.<|endoftext|>It's kind of like your little bit of space is really restricted when you're trying to -<|endoftext|>A lot of times when you're
So once you quit smoking everything changes for you, you're kind of gone for good.<|endoftext|>This isn't just about sort of the physical aspect of quitting. You can sort of instead just focus on the social aspect.<|endoftext|>It sounds like there are a lot of social factors that go into making this decision to start cold turkey or not.<|endoftext|>You said you weren't really into being dependent on medication,<|endoftext|>T. So you'd like to instead focus on the social aspect of the medication<|endoftext|>From what I wrote below, you seem to be very, like a really good, active person. You take your medications quite regularly. I remember you were saying you
136. Mm hmm.<|endoftext|>T. So your family is really important to you.<|endoftext|>In doing this you're trying to use your experience and knowledge of what
T. And having that relationship with him is really important for you and<|endoftext|>Okay. So, um. There are a lot of reasons that tie into this for you, and all of them have to
You're feeling a little bit nervous about taking it out of your life but yet you're really ready to do it<|endoftext|>So you're really ready to do it<|endoftext|>We went back to school today to kind of increase our time in the car. Thursday morning I had to take a stroll and so we were at school until around 10:00. So
T....to talk about how it's important for you to be healthy...<|endoftext|>Right, and you're here because you want to talk about...<|endoftext|>T....whether or not that's healthy for you or whether or not you're able to be, um...<|endoftext|>But when you
But just, lately, you've seen yourself, ah - fall short, and this really kind of terrifies you.<|endoftext|>In this case you said you know of people who smoke and they
It's not normally a concern for you.<|endoftext|>Do you smoke, do you think, at least consciously, during your swimming?<|endoftext|>Okay, so it seems like that's something you think
Your divorced, okay.<|endoftext|>Ok. So your divorced, okay. So your divorced, okay<|endoftext|>So you, um the amount of time that you want to spend with your family is limited. You are able to take one cigarette at a time and that's it.<|endoftext|>T. So you noticed that it's kind of difficult to stay completely away from that.<|endoftext|>Your friends have been telling you about the importance of quitting smoking and you really want to make that decision when it's time to quit
Four and five?<|endoftext|>***Updated with additional information and guidelines.***It's important that you take your medications and you take them consistently, but it sounds like you are starting to have some difficulty in pinpointing exactly what medications you should and shouldn't be taking.<|endoftext|>In a recent interview, you mentioned that your daughter has concerns for her own weight as well. This is something you have been mentioning
T. They are the reasons you chose being a mom.<|endoftext|>About two weeks ago I got a new job.
He's very important for you.<|endoftext|>Maybe becoming a father, um, you, would be able
T. And your ( inaudible ) caretaker.<|endoftext|>Analyst: Depress. Okay.<|endoftext|>Ok, so you're nervous about quitting smoking, but you see some benefits, and you think
T. And maybe some of those might be related to your work.<|endoftext|>Okay, so your daughter and your grandson... pretty much just got you on the map, they said the word " t. " You want to take your medications and kinda do whatever you can to help the best for them.<|endoftext|>So your
So you're...<|endoftext|>So you had a diagnosis from your doctor and they told you that you needed to take this medication. And now you're at 2:00 in the morning and it's...um...from 2
T. And that you can focus more on yourself<|endoftext|>It sounds like your children's health is really important to you.<|endoftext|>#Right. And then you're confident that there's enough information out there to help you with that process.<|endoftext|>T. So we talked a little about what kind of fits in your lifestyle now.<|endoftext|>#So you're starting to see some benefits from
T. which is kind of scary and worrisome to you.<|endoftext|>For a lot of reasons. It's a diagnosis given at a very scary time. Also your father's history of heart disease and also your swimming.<|endoftext|>A couple of days ago you were actually diagnosed with pre - diabetes. Um... So
T....you don't want to have to be smoking all the time...<|endoftext|>A funky little 8 in the morning. So it sounds like someone who is not a morning person...<|endoftext|>From what I can tell, it sounds like you've been smoking since you were fifteen. Um...I mean, there have been some changes. Um...you look like you're maybe gaining some weight in your life. Um...you've been smoking for a while. So it's something you can look at
you've tried the nicotine and it sounds like it didn't quite, it didn't quite work.<|endoftext|>T. You had hoped that it would work but it - it just didn't quite work for you.
Not the possibility of like messing with your health, or messing with your relationships with your children -<|endoftext|>Sounds like you're afraid that it's going to continue to get worse if you don't address
T. Something to consider, maybe<|endoftext|>The party was really fun. There was no drugs at all at the
T. Okay, so that's when you really started to notice the effects of your smoking.<|endoftext|>About a pack and a half today.<|endoftext|>In terms of the medication, most recently, we have your
Seems like you, ah - have been smoking for, ah - quite a long time...<|endoftext|>A while. But recently it's...it's kind of affecting something that you really like to
T. Yeah. Okay. So if your family were maybe a model family, a model family, you would think that would be something that would be pretty important to you.<|endoftext|>It seems like the last time
And um, you also mentioned weight loss. Um, your father has had some pretty severe complications from diabetes and weight loss.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're feeling a little bit of hopeless at this point.<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like being a role model is perhaps what's going to help you change this behavior.<|endoftext|>Anchorage is
It sounds like a difficult transition -<|endoftext|>With your father having recently had some pretty bad side effects and being on the hot seat for a while.<|endoftext|>A shortness of breath.<|endoftext|>In terms
And how that kind of relates to happiness and how important it is for you to take your medications<|endoftext|>This is something that's very important to you<|endoftext|>Well that's good that we've covered. There are some good reasons why you want to stop smoking. The health of your grandkids and also the
Yeah, so you value your health and you value being active.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you value being your active, too. You know, you value being healthy, especially in your future because your
So, that's something that's really important to you and something that you'd like to try.<|endoftext|>A 10.00 sounds like it's a good time<|endoftext|>An 8.00 sounds like it's a good time<|endoftext|>T. Eight is better than a 1.00.<|endoftext|>Ok. So try to find something that is within that eight hour window.<|endoftext|>In terms of the appointments, you mentioned that on your own time is better than a 10:00 sounds like it.<|endoftext|>So if you have an 8.00 on your own time and you are confident that you can do that, you might do that.<|endoftext|>The next few days at
So you mentioned just now your physical fitness -<|endoftext|>So you're concerned because your grandson is very active.<|endoftext|>It's a concern for you that your grandson might be gaining some weight.<|endoftext|>
Sure. You don't have any family time and you're trying to find something to do on that weekend at the lake with that maybe that...it sounds like just a lot of pressure.<|endoftext|>You said that you had been in the clinic before with the flu before and that just didn't work for you...<|endoftext|>Ok. So you said that's why you didn't want to go in again.<|endoftext|>It kind of like a pattern and if you get sick again you're going
Health and active.<|endoftext|>Uh huh. And then you also mentioned that you value, you know, being a mother, being a good parent. And being in control.<|endoftext|>You also mentioned being a good grandparent.<|endoftext|>T. Okay. So that's something that you value as a grandparent.<|endoftext|>Your children are very important to you. If you
So, it's important to you, um... to be here...to talk and to...to talk about the change that you're wanting to make.<|endoftext|>T....to talk about quitting smoking. So... Um... You talked a lot about uh... being, um... kind of
Like the sometimes you have to hold the cigarette just forcibly<|endoftext|>What happened next to you<|endoftext|>Forums.com Forums.<|endoftext|>In the past, we've covered, you didn't know, um, what it's like to smoke a cigarette. So we've talked about some of the different types and levels of smoking, what they're doing and because of the different health concerns. So you really just really didn't know what to expect when you try and quit.
So I know that you talked about how sometimes you don't get a result but you want something for sure that's going to work<|endoftext|>In terms of your adherence, um, it sounds like, you
T. So I mean, and so one hundred percent that, that's not something that would necessarily work.<|endoftext|>So you feel that maybe if you went on these diets that you, you might not...<|endoftext|>T....Be able to play a part in the family and maybe work with your kids.<|endoftext|>At a meeting I was going to try and
Um, you tried nicotine replacement therapy gums<|endoftext|>Kinda make that decision after consulting with your family
Okay. So it sounds like you are a little concerned about this weight gain that you've experienced in the past. Um.<|endoftext|>Most recently it's, uh, affecting your family members and maybe also the people you love.<|endoftext|>In your daily life, your role model is your responsibility to take care of your children.<|endoftext|>The responsibility to take care of your children and to have them be
so, you mentioned you would not do this cold turkey again.<|endoftext|>Like you said, you are not into cigarettes. Seems like you would be more comfortable with using a non - nicotine replacement therapy option.<|endoftext|>A non - nicotine replacement therapy option
So, you need to fit that in the day and you also need to make sure that you're teaching anyhow.<|endoftext|>So you think, written everything down, that that this was something that was going to work<|endoftext|>Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that you knew exactly what you were going to say. But you
Um, so what came over during your attempts to quit smoking was that there are some negatives that make it really difficult to quit. So although you were really high up the nicotine ladder at the time, it was really, um, difficult to manage the withdrawal and
So you...you had a great week, it was kind of a good week of being up and actually doing things, kinda good.<|endoftext|>The swimming experience to you was really enjoyable and you were able to get some exercise because it was at a time where there were no
You need to talk with your husband to hear what's going on.<|endoftext|>Right, you need to find out more about the nicotine replacement therapy (K2) option, and you also mentioned looking into different medications. We talked about some of those options that are out there and you're interested in finding out more about them.<|endoftext|>Two, and that's kind of helpful.<|endoftext|>It also sounds
So it's an addition to the - the medication. It's not a drug.<|endoftext|>You know, you've seen the devastating effects first hand of smoking and it's almost as if you've already committed a crime.<|endoftext|>This is really important to you. We should stop for now. But we will definitely be back in touch soon. Well good luck on att
T. But in fact, maybe it's your role to kind of get into the process and figure out how to get healthier and quit smoking and so some way to do it without having to sacrifice your grand sons.<|endoftext|>With your having a couple extra days at a time at a time which is very important to you.<|endoftext|>Okay. So a two or a three<|endoftext|>Your kids. Two or three. Yeah, that's kind of what I'm hearing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a couple extra days there, so it's difficult for you on time or you're feeling that you have to you can't help them.<|endoftext|>The family is coming over for dinner tonight. Um, so you and your kids are going to a nice
166. That's okay.<|endoftext|>Like this is getting in the way of thinking about your own smoking.<|endoftext|>T. It's preventing you from thinking about yourself as well as you can be and it's also preventing you from thinking about your
Ok. So not too big as big as big as big as you think.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like its not an option for you to eat out a lot or to be very active. It also sounds like you
So, that's really scary to think that you could be this person and actually be competent in that way.<|endoftext|>A/k because this has happened before.<|endoftext|>So, it sounds like the cold turkey and other options, like the nicotine replacement, are not really a options for you.
It sounds like something you like to do, you know you like to drive.<|endoftext|>Um, so it feels good to smoke when you're stressed, it doesn't feel like something that you're just passively driving on.<|endoftext|>A good set and good start for you.<|endoftext|>A good Sunday morning activity to look at and focus on. The fact that your grandson is pre - diabetic -<|endoftext|>T. - um, caused you know, concern for him and motivated you to, to keep swimming and seeing him.<|endoftext|>T. - so having that
T. Raising your kids and making sure that they're healthy.<|endoftext|>In making sure that you have quality time with your family.<|endoftext|>So being there for your family.<|endoftext|>Three or four
Umhmm. Will they - will, you'll be able to manage this, okay? Will it be okay? Will it be okay?<|endoftext|>Aaah. So aah. So being irritable, you don't want to be around people who are also very busy.<|endoftext|>In sports you are
So that's really what's going to help you cut back or quit smoking or find other ways to deal with the cravings or cravings for cigarettes so you're not feeling like you're restricted.<|endoftext|>You're not restricted when you're around your family. So why is it important to you when you're at work?<|endoftext|>The thought of having to
You were recently diagnosed with pre - diabetes.<|endoftext|>The story started out really fun for you. You had some fun with it.<|endoftext|>Okay.
Okay, so your - your health also, it seems like, maybe is affected by this smoking.<|endoftext|>T. And your smoking seems to be getting in the way of, or out of
And so you feel like that it kinda has a double edged sword<|endoftext|>: Yeahiteddit, you have pneumonia.<|endoftext|>A: So it sounds like having that as a background, having a
And you're worried that she might actually follow in your footsteps?<|endoftext|>A little bit. A little concerned.<|endoftext|>Okay. Okay. But it's more of a general concern for you in terms of your own health and also the future
you take them.<|endoftext|>T. You feel like you've been smoking for a while and you
- for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your - your grandson really motivates you -<|endoftext|>Okay so being around him is really important.<|endoftext|>Have
Yeah. And, that could be an option.<|endoftext|>#It also seems like, you know, these diets...they're usually pretty regimented. If you're willing to follow them...<|endoftext|>I remember you talking about trying to lose weight
T. And then you tried it in the past and it just kind of, it wasn't getting anywhere.<|endoftext|>Okay. So where do you see the connection between diet and weight now?<|endoftext|>Okay. So, it sounds like
So, the lunch is always kinda...<|endoftext|>So, you have two working stools.<|endoftext|>Seven or eight?<|endoftext|>The longest one and shortest one.<|endoftext|>We are going try and get some information from you as soon as possible.<|endoftext|>So you really value taking care of
T. Whereas now your family, you know, is mostly opposed to you trying to replace one therapy with another.<|endoftext|>You had mentioned some of the positives,
T. If you can't, obviously, come up with a plan, or a way to fit the cessation into your life, obviously you want to stop.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've taken um, a lot of steps to quit smoking, both your parents did.<|endoftext|>So you've tried quitting before.
T....as far as your physical health is concerned.<|endoftext|>Umm... Gorski's Law kind of thing<|endoftext|>A little bit of a physical toll on your body.<|endoftext|>The thought of going back for a second is just too much to bear.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you don't want to go back for a second and have to make some difficult decisions.<|endoftext|>It sounds like moving forward you believe that
Okay. So that might be a good option.<|endoftext|>You never thought about it but right now you feel like maybe you've got some weight issues<|endoftext|>In regards to your health. Your grandson has obesity.<|endoftext|>A wanting to become
Yeah, so I mean, you mentioned maybe that you go to the fast food, it sort of seems that way, but you generally don't
T. And also that, you have had some pretty severe side effects come associated with the weight gain that you've experienced in the past.<|endoftext|>In addition to your personal health, these effects have included: insomnia, which you've thought you've had you've been experiencing might be related to weight gain
so pretty much you know, it sounds like you're pretty busy person living in a big city with a full schedule of work and you don't have much time for yourself so it puts you at a greater
You said that your fullness and energy usually is not there during the day, so it makes it very difficult to maintain that.<|endoftext|>Anthropogenic activity (gas and smoke in the house) on your clothes is one possible option.<|endoftext|>The second is the
Sometimes you don't make it that far.<|endoftext|>This is from my past experience of being a mother
So you said you enjoy it.<|endoftext|>Sometimes you enjoy being alone...<|endoftext|>I know that last time you talked about how you kind of see the connection between your smoking and your swimming as a way to really
Seven or Eight?<|endoftext|>A seven or eight?<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've had some experience with quitting in the past, both as a doctor and as a counselor. And that experience has lent you an interest in counseling cessation and other kinds of groups. But you're here
T. Smoking kind of fits in with...<|endoftext|>T....your life as well.<|endoftext|>T....as a parent.<|endoftext|>The second [?? ] was the worst. [?? ] The second [?? ] was the best, um, so I think that's because you told me that's kind of how [?? ] connected or featured you as a good parent.
So you were concerned about how something you were eating could affect the developing immune system and the overall health of your daughter<|endoftext|>The seven week window for pre - diabetes diagnosis was frustrating for you, this diabetes wasn't coming from your family. And then your daughter also had a pre - diabetes diagnosis. With the possibility that she might have pre - diabetes as well.<|endoftext|>I
T. And so that'll kind of reinforce that feeling of being a good parent to be a good example.<|endoftext|>Okay. And, um, telling your story to your children and telling them in a way that's going to be healthy for them<|endoftext|>A seven or eight?<|endoftext|>T. So that's like a good
Ok. So you learned a lot from it<|endoftext|>Like swimming and you really like going...<|endoftext|>The activity and the health of your grandson...<|endoftext|>It
So that extra weight gain is something that definitely works for you because it helps you to stay on and do the things that you're doing.<|endoftext|>T. And maintaining those habits helps you kind of feel like this is a place of strength and this is a place where you can really thrive.<|endoftext|>Well this is good. It's sounds like you you people have been through a lot in the past and this has kind of been a...it sounds like that's something that's
because you're starting to see some of the effects of your smoking on your health.<|endoftext|>Okay. Um, so I guess you're concerned about how the exercise that you're doing might affect your health because you said you've tried it before...<|endoftext|>So you
And for you right now, your quality versus your quantity makes this easier, you feel like a lot more satisfied, like you're much more confident<|endoftext|>Theorem [ edit ]
So, quality versus quantity.<|endoftext|>A lot of times when
You wanted to - you tried to do cold turkey and it -<|endoftext|>T. - That didn't work out so well for you -
And, to be sure, you know, in a sense it's like, you're taking something away from someone else<|endoftext|>This is not a choice that you're really comfortable with.<|endoftext|>T. You've tried some other things on your own and there's some drawbacks and some positives about using it.<|endoftext|>A couple of weeks ago we had the issue of people coming here for the HIV testing and, and, like it is very important to you, it
2 or 3 weeks is good.<|endoftext|>This, um, is where the research is. It's not the diagnosis or the thing that's going to do it.<|endoftext|>About three weeks in Hungary and that might not be the longest you've ever been on medication.<|endoftext|>Okay. So
T. Um and so you don't want to feel like you're restricted...<|endoftext|>In terms of time and...or energy is a big factor for you.<|endoftext|>A big one.<|endoftext|>It's important because you're taking your meds at 7:
and you feel like, that you've achieved something.<|endoftext|>T. That sounds like a pretty hard feat for a person to accomplish.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds like you've identified a couple of things that are either barriers to working or areas of your life that you would like to change to help improve your health.<|endoftext|>Ok. So
So. Mmm hmm. You've talked a lot about these, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, these programs and - and how
so, yeah, it's almost as if smoking is an addiction and it's getting in the way of being a good parent.<|endoftext|>So you're getting a little bit concerned. You even though your grandson is very important to you, and a
49. Um - hmm.<|endoftext|>A lot of times when you take your meds you kinda have to stop and take them because the leg is hurting.<|endoftext|>An eight or eight?<|endoftext|>I don't have time for that.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your schedule is
And um, so um, when you did break up your meals, um, were fine with the portion sizes that you were taking.<|endoftext|>It sounds like that you had some success with the diet in the past and you're making some serious changes now that you're engaged in eating more healthy. It can be a daunting task when you are trying to plan out what you're going to eat and how you're going to fit it
And, you mentioned earlier, umm, maybe cutting down is one solution that you could try.<|endoftext|>T. Let's say two. The first is maybe reducing the amount of calories.<|endoftext|>Kinda like Atkins and then the fad diets.<|endoftext|>So you're
And you did try to get sick again but you erry got the shingles and nothing could work for you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like family is very important to you.<|endoftext|>
Something, but even though not something that's going to last forever, something that's going to work<|endoftext|>In many areas throughout your life you have grandkids and grandkids. Grandkids are a
So, you're thinking a solution is to talk to your, uhm, talk to your daughter, maybe go on a talk and explain that changing your
some people look at it like that, but really it's really just a -<|endoftext|>So you see a real connection between your adherence and preventing the spread of HIV and actually preventing the HIV viral load.<|endoftext|>Because you have so much going on during the day that's really important to you<|endoftext|>A lot
So you want to be there for your family, you want to be there for your children, especially<|endoftext|>T. Sure, sure.<|endoftext|>Ok. So just for, like, you mentioned being a good parent, being responsible, being responsible, you don't want to be hypocritical these values that you want to hold yourself to.<|endoftext|>So being a good parent is really important to you.<|endoftext|>Okay so being a good spouse is really important to you.<|endoftext|>Ok. So being responsible is really important to you.<|endoftext|>A good parent to be a good role model for your children and a good role model. So if you don't, um...you don't wanna be hypocritical you, you want to at least take
T. And spend time with him is something I can get a hold of.<|endoftext|>I guess that you really like spending time with your grandson. It's a great bonding experience
T. Being confident<|endoftext|>Oh ok, so, yeah. So being confident<|endoftext|>This is something that
OK, you said you were a 4 or a 5<|endoftext|>So it's pretty important to you to take your meds<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your family is really important to you.<|endoftext|>So you mentioned your daughter,<|endoftext|>We just
T. And also, um, umm, just a general lack of time and energy.<|endoftext|>You sound a little bit
OK. So you're worried about that kind of stuff going on. So...<|endoftext|>It's... it's hard to let yourself down when you've seen what your father has been through.<|endoftext|>The past has brought
So you're concerned about your health and you're concerned about your own weight.<|endoftext|>2: Yeah, so that's why you're interested in that.<|endoftext|>The second part of the schedule is the reading at 6:00
And it is very important for you to take your medications<|endoftext|>Okay. So we talked about how maybe some of the values that you mentioned really connect with the adherence and
And so on.<|endoftext|>I remember you said you were at 83% and now it's up to 100%. Ok.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you
Um, you know, you have tried the nicotine replacement therapy gums<|endoftext|>T
T. And you're concerned that your daughter might actually have pre - diabetes because she's fallen in the same type of lifestyle?<|endoftext|>Okay, so your worried is probably based on your husband's recent diagnosis of prediabetes and you don't want that to happen.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like that prediabetes is something you're
But obviously we need to stop for now.<|endoftext|>T. So let's talk about, um... your family history, um...your father being a very religious person...um...and your recent, uh... diagnosis of pre - diabetes has really alarmed you, you said...um...that there are a
T. Like a good parent, to read,<|endoftext|>So you have a lot of, um great values and a lot of...uh
Sure, Yes it seems that maybe getting to know people outside of the office during the week, and not having as much opportunity to kind of smoke, and also friends or family members that smoke, is, is something that maybe, that is important for you...<|endoftext|>So, it sounds like finding a way to get all of your family together would be a very important step for you and for your daughter.<|endoftext|>I
So you're hopeful that...<|endoftext|>The thought In terms of feeling better, eating better is what's going to get you through this.<|endoftext|>The thought of that is pretty iffy<|endoftext|>Ok. So we've talked about how you struggle with your weight and how sometimes you're successful and other times you're not. It's a lot of multiple choice, a lot of, a lot of pain in the butt. So it sounds like you've been asking for a lot of things
Yeah, I'm hearing that it sounds like talking to someone who really understands the struggles that you've had with quitting, it sounds like talking to someone who understands it might be easier said
So, you're really scared about even being able to do this without it becoming an even bigger issue<|endoftext|>Okay. So weird it's kind of quiet...it
T. When he comes over. Recreational. And then, at the beginning of your interview, you mentioned that you were using the cigarette to relax, and kind of kick back, [??
So that's a great benefit to you.<|endoftext|>In this three hour window, you worked out an eight-hour plan for taking your medications with your family on top of that time.<|endoftext|>Ok so we established that
Yeah. And it sounds like that the feeling of not being able to do something, like you said
So, it sounds like, at this point, you've tried most of the time on your own and it just hasn't worked for you because of these withdrawal symptoms.<|endoftext|>It's kind of frustrating to you that your medications don
so you feel bad forgetting to take these medications.<|endoftext|>A little bit of having to do it on your own and feeling it take a bit more on your own<|endoftext|>It sounds like for you, more of a decision making process where you care for yourself more and take care of yourself less will be better.
T. And gradually reduce the amount of smoking<|endoftext|>You give you the motivation to keep going<|endoftext|>Your confidence is high because it sounds like you're coming from a place of really high -
And you feel that that this, this, this tiered relationship that you're feeling like you'd really be able to hold yourself to a higher standard maybe than you were able to set yourself up with the, the responsibility and everything.<|endoftext|>Yes. That's a big positive for you.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you, you have been diagnosed with pre - diabetes
T. Your family history is a concern, you know, and your grandson is very important to you.<|endoftext|>A great example for your children, a good role model for your children.<|endoftext|>It can also be a frustrating experience for your own health.<|endoftext|>A good example for your children seeing
So you're concerned about maintaining your health even when your going out to eat.<|endoftext|>It seems like you mentioned exercise is kind of something that's helpful for you.<|endoftext|>So impressive. So losing weight is something that's been very challenging for you in the past and has been a very frustrating experience for you.<|endoftext|>For
Yeah. And then maybe if we do something more informal like we did at our meeting, kind of like your friends do, we can help you quit a little bit more.<|endoftext|>T. So it sounds like you've had some experience with quitting...
T. You smoke in the car, so it's a chance for you to kind of sneak into work or wherever you are...<|endoftext|>In the car, in the car?<|endoftext|>So you prepare your meals ahead of time and you bring it.<|endoftext|>Okay. Um and the snack areas are areas that are not necessarily busy during the week.<|endoftext|>Avenues are usually busy. So it's very important to you...<|endoftext|>I know that you said that being responsible for your family is very important to you...<|endoftext|>So it sounds like your husband is sort of and quite a bit concerned about this, since he
T. That's another reason that it's important for you to take your meds.<|endoftext|>The doctor told me that you're very concerned about your weight and he told me that there's a genetic component
T. Okay, so in college you were at about a pack and a half a day.<|endoftext|>T. Okay. So, um
T. And it's even though you are now able to do it, you may not be able to do it again<|endoftext|>There's some pride in knowing that you can
T. And really looking at uh the positive side of that you can see positive steps for yourself and also being confident that you can take these positive steps and then later on to do that other part. Kinda like having a plan for how to move forward and make sure you're gonna make it better and be
You have been talking a lot about how you are nervous and kind of frustrated with your husband and that...<|endoftext|>In terms of confidence, you said you had hoped that, you know, you'd
T. So it's difficult for you in the winter because you...<|endoftext|>You don't really have that extra time where you're just kind of hanging out and garden.<|endoftext|>T. Just, it's hard to get out and do anything.<|endoftext|>Maybe you think it is important to take your medications because when you're not exercising you have more time in your schedule, so that's why you think it is important to take your medications.<|endoftext|>You're also seven weeks along for your scheduled
But it also seems like it can be really -- really an antagonist for you, too.<|endoftext|>You said you had been smoking for several years. You said it's an important stress reliever.<|endoftext|>But now it's become -- it's kind of an even
But you're open minded. Um, you don't want to kind of go the - waste of time if your
Right the french fries on the side.<|endoftext|>With the side salad, everything, it sort of sounds like something you could do, but it's challenging when there are so many other things that competing for your time and energy.<|endoftext|>#So, you know that's, you know, thinking about when and how you make those choices.<|endoftext|>Okay, so it sounds like Sundays are really important to you. And as far as making a schedule for yourself, making sure you
so its like a regular thing..<|endoftext|>Um hmm. So it sounds like you have been on medications before and you haven't gotten sick.<|endoftext|>It
- for, say, within the next month.<|endoftext|>It also sounds like you've had some setbacks, as well - recently as in your attempts to quit, you've had some setbacks, as well - recently as in your attempts to quit smoking, you've
T. Find something that is healthy.<|endoftext|>Um... Ok. So, let's talk about exercise. Um... there's been a lot that you've tried in sports and you know that those haven't been very successful but your goal is to get better -<|endoftext|>It's been pretty frustrating to you in the past. Um... maybe it's time for you
You really feel ready to make the change.<|endoftext|>T. Yeah ; it's a big part of your life now.<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like gum is a very strong ally for you, because you, you know, when you're stressed, especially if you're coming in to stress relief, because
T. You don't want to be a burden to your children. Um<|endoftext|>It's hard for a lot of people to lose weight, so much of your thinking is about maintaining or losing weight.<|endoftext|>Ok. So you've mentioned a couple things: our family, your grandson, and your swimming, and that's something you think is very important. Natural changes, being in good health, and your grandchildren.<|endoftext|>In doing, your seeing how your behaviors and your family tie in with each other and how you really want to live a healthy life.<|endoftext|>In doing the things you love,
T. And it's challenging you physically because you're not used to being that tired.<|endoftext|>Um, so you've tried many diets in the past and none of them have really worked<|endoftext|>Your kids are really important for you.<|endoftext|>#T. Yeah. So you've tried some previous
hopeful that you can get some good health from it.<|endoftext|>$49. Uh
so you've seen the reactions and you're really starting to notice how it's playing into your daily life.<|endoftext|>Okay. So that's why you're excited to start.<|endoftext|>T. Okay. Alright. Sounds like your kids are really important to you.<|endoftext|>You were saying that your daughter also told me about this medication....<|endoftext|>In
So it sounds like, based on what you've told me, that you've had some side effects with other medications in the past and that is the first time you've tried anything in the past
Um... you started to notice this take a toll on your health...um...in early adulthood when you were in the pre - diabetic phase...um
You have to get out of the pool and you don't have the energy to do it.<|endoftext|>A three or four years old boy has asthma.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds like a pretty difficult situation. Trying to manage a three or four year old, you feel like, you know, you have tried in the past and it just hasn't
About four or five<|endoftext|>It sounds like smoking is sort of a coping mechanism for you, sort of, to get through certain times in your life.<|endoftext|>Ok, so in terms of your swimming, just kind of, body is not like, you haven't been able
So, um, you mentioned that at one point you tried an interesting diet but it just, it, it kind of, it didn't work out long term.<|endoftext|>Okay. And um, so we've covered a lot of the things that
Um, you're worried about making sure everything's right.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you have a couple of things motivating you here. You're worried about making it that far, and the second, uh, you're worried about consequences.<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like there are a few reasons you wanna make this attempt. You're worried about quitting smoking, and you're worried about maintaining
So the positive is that you're already feeling better that you're able to do the things you normally do. Sounds like that's a positive<|endoftext|>In my past life, I've noticed that your health also benefits. Your grandson is very important to you and you want to make sure that he's healthy also.<|endoftext|>From an eight to eight, or eight?<|endoftext|>A good eight?<|endoftext|>From an eight to eight, okay.<|endoftext|>A good eight?<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds
So, it's always there, it's always nice for you...<|endoftext|>Okay. So it sounds like some of the reasons that you said you were cold turkey and were not confident about trying to quit smoking are because you have tried that before...<|endoftext|>A: Uh huh. It's not something that we're going to talk about.<|endoftext|>With your recent diagnosis of pre - diabetes
T. You know I know you mentioned your daughter's concerns were there and you know, your concern about your daughter's health, so you clearly want to work it in, but you can't say don't, you need to
T. Ok. You discussed your daughter earlier<|endoftext|>Sure.<|endoftext|>A friend through the grapefruit restaurant told me that the best way to get healthy is to eat healthier and if you can find healthy options outside the house then that will also help you be successful.<|endoftext|>There are a lot of health conscious restaurant environments in the city, so it's very enticing to you.<|endoftext|>Um so, um, it sounds like, um, you know, just a
T. It's just not worth attempting sometimes.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you have some - sort of range anxiety about what your reading is going to lead you to do.
Yeah. So, it sounds like...it's frustrating to you that...that hasn't worked for you in the past but there have been some successes. Perhaps, you just wanna look forward and try again.<|endoftext|>Kronosmos is a big part of being a good parent.
Um, so it sounds like you've been thinking of different options.<|endoftext|>In the past
OK, so you're definitely not a fan of it.<|endoftext|>Well it sounds like you, uh, a lot of times your smoking habits are like the reasons you're overweight and you see negative health consequences, especially if you're trying to quit and your weight gain is making it more difficult to breathe.<|endoftext|>The last thing you want to be doing. You're afraid of what it could mean in the long run if you don't change your life.<|endoftext|>So looking forward, what you've mentioned is that your kids, your grandson, has a really supportive support.<|endoftext|>T. You have another person in your life who's really
It's tough for everybody.<|endoftext|>So you're terrified that, you know, even though it's something that you really want to avoid, it's something that's, it's difficult for everybody because you're not sure how to get there.<|endoftext|>You didn't like the cold turkey, did you.<|endoftext|>Are you a gum chewer and a cigarrette chewer, are you
- the other things that you wanted to do, but you were not sure if you could.<|endoftext|>It's been a while?<|endoftext|>In the past year
So and and so for you, if you have a lot of busy people and a lot of responsibilities at home it's time that you're not spending that time cooking...<|endoftext|>In the past week, you've had some pretty terrible days. Your family is being really bad. You're being really hard on yourself. Everything has sort
Six foods you can eat<|endoftext|>An 8 o clock sounds like that's a good time<|endoftext|>In terms of your energy level, if you have the opportunity to go to the gym at 1:00 on weekdays, that might be an 8 o clock at night. Um...<|endoftext|>Two 8:00 sounds like it's a good time<|endoftext|>I
