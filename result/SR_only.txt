From what you've told me so far.<|endoftext|>I remember you talking about three different types of fruits and vegetables.<|endoftext|>From the vegetable family, the ones that you know are sweet and tart
Which maybe could've, possibly worked for a little bit but it didn't quite, uh, feel like you were getting the nicotine gum and it didn't quite, uh, feel like you were getting
honestly. Yeah. I mean clearly you're not getting well fast. You're really struggling with this major factor that's kind of keeping you down.<|endoftext|>Okay. So we've got the lab stuff under control. And the
It sounds like it.<|endoftext|>You recently joined Weight Watchers as an alarm clock user.<|endoftext|>You recently joined Weight
T. Making steps<|endoftext|>Right. So you're already kind of, preparing yourself...<|endoftext|>I'll just summarize
Versus what you were dealing with.<|endoftext|>Okay so. You've been using in the past and you said you didn't like the peppery taste.<|endoftext|>Jade is
T. So since we've talked about how you actually quit, let me just ask you about how you help people when you're in a bad mood.<|endoftext|>A federal judge in your own home courtroom.
Yeah, so, um, if you
He also is single parent, so, so that's not a good option for you.<|endoftext|>T. And then you go to the doctor and get that done.<|endoftext|>From there you
So you feel like the failure was sort of on the side of the drug.<|endoftext|>T. So you're afraid that because you didn't quite succeed what you tried and it didn't quite, what you
Four - ok.<|endoftext|>Nicorette gum is an option.<|endoftext|>So you are concerned about losing weight cause you say your father is diabetic and your
Yea so it might be an option.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've gone cold turkey before...<|endoftext|>So you've tried to stop smoking before...since you were 16. And you've tried other things...<|endoftext|>Ã‰dououard, you said it's kind of this...this is a pattern for you.
Seven, okay.<|endoftext|>There have been a lot of discussions about alternative medicine in the last month. So you're interested in hearing more about them
Yeah, yeah it can be very hard.<|endoftext|>A good example of a good parent and a good example of a good role model for your children, um.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your kids have been a good example to
You said you can help you and help you understand some of the issues, so that will be helpful for you.<|endoftext|>A Bronx friend recently joined the program and so
A 9 or a 10?<|endoftext|>Well it's important. So it sounds like it's, uh, being able to discuss these important things with your family and being able to, you know, talk to people about these important things and also kind of having, you know, some comfort that you can, and um, having that, you know, like that's really important to you.<|endoftext|>A little bit depressing. The way you chose to say that, uh, was? Maybe you, maybe tried to reduce the amount of smoking
And trying to relate to what happens in your daily life and how you relate to those things<|endoftext|>Mm hm.
T. Ok, well that's good. Well that's that's another reason that you wanted to grab it early.<|endoftext|>An 8. Um -
Um, it sounds like your husband regards you as a...this...this...this is just
Yeah, yeah so there's a few things that I could think of do that would help you kind of while you're thinking about what you wanna do...<|endoftext|>The main thing that makes, um, your time on your feet and your hands more productive.<|endoftext|>Ok. So you mentioned cold turkey and turkey in-house
Tie something around your finger.<|endoftext|>An 8 is a high score. So we have you on a higher score. Okay.<|endoftext|>Bou
So it might be a good starting point for you.<|endoftext|>So maybe a few of those 7 or 8 options might be better for you.<|endoftext|>There's a few options open.<|endoftext|>A few options open. So you talked about some of the 7 or 8 options. And then you chose a health food for your family.<|endoftext|>You chose a healthy food.<|endoftext|>It looks like you know what makes you feel good.<|endoftext|>An 8-ish. Okay.<|endoftext|>Independent news organizations that are friendly to the Kremlin have already started to focus on finding new ways to reach out
So, you, you live and you do your things.<|endoftext|>* New York Times, Sunday Times, and, and, and, oh on.<|endoftext|>T. And then you are, uh, becoming a mom.<|endoftext|>A mom to your daughter?
Um, yeah. She's become a mom.<|endoftext|>From that little bit of negative reinforcement your confidence can get going.<|endoftext|>Making those lifestyle changes doesn't have to do with being depressed.<|endoftext|>An 8<|endoftext|>A 7 or an 8?<|endoftext|>This is going to sound like
T. Ok. So it sounds like parenting through the media is something that you're really interested in doing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like when you were in college you were maybe a two or three...<|endoftext|>K and then after you graduated college you went back down to about a two or three.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you went from being a two or three to a one.<|endoftext|>
T. So you mentioned that, you know, under the influence of your family you have not been successful in the past. That you have to be really conscious of that. And, you're, you're worried about that, just kind of worry about, you
T. Um, so you fear that your smoking may affect his asthma, but you also fear that your smoking may affect his cognitive ability.<|endoftext|>It sounds like smoking can be potentially very helpful to you in some ways. Your grandson may actually benefit from some cognitive behavioral therapy to help
and you mentioned some of the healthier options that you're thinking of are fruit and, I - umm, vegetables.<|endoftext|>Okay, so we know that you are concerned about your weight as a result of your, uh, eating habits and
So no more interference. Ok.<|endoftext|>So, um, you tried the nicotine gum. It didn't work.<|endoftext|>Okay. So it seems like we've connected the dots. You're ready to quit.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you've been smoking for a very long time. You haven't had any difficulty quitting. Very few people have.<|endoftext|>About three months
There have been a
So you've tried, you've tried a number of things<|endoftext|>So you talked about wanting to try taking some exercise, um, maybe walking, walking, and biking, but also some types of physical activity.<|endoftext|>I know that you mentioned your daughter earlier, but she's
T. Something to put on the plate.<|endoftext|>Do you, when you get your plate, do you, do you, do you, do you mind if I take anything?<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you, when you get your plate, do you, do you mind if I take any?<|endoftext|>T. Yes. You are concerned about the side effects and you mentioned that you sometimes go to the restroom before when
T. - you know, after you've been smoking, it's your responsibility to not do it again, but you still have
T. You have been referred today by your doctor specifically because of concerns with your pre - diabetes.<|endoftext|>About your pre - diabetes.<|endoftext|>#with your doctor.<|endoftext|>So you mentioned that your sister
Ok. So, at this point, it sounds like your doctor told you that this is kind of a concern for you as well as for your children<|endoftext|>Like you said earlier, being a mother and being a positive role model are two very important things to you<|endoftext|>Do you know about the gum<|endoftext|>Auschwitz is a very important value. One's a positive role model for your children?<|endoftext|>A
...the 2 - hour stuff.<|endoftext|>You tried to stop smoking in the past but that didn't work out so well and also
T.<|endoftext|>You mentioned two things. One is that you talked about two aversions.
Time with your family that you spend with each other.<|endoftext|>T. So what I'm hearing from you is that's something you can work on gradually but not necessarily feel like you
T. And, finding, finding a dietician.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you're a little bit concerned about seeing your father seeing how this affects your, um, sense of, your grandchilds health, making, um, more healthy choices down the line.
T. You tried multiple times.<|endoftext|>T. Right. So you, uh, tried several
You've tried and it just hasn't worked for you.<|endoftext|>And so throughout our conversations, you've mentioned multiple things have been difficult. Your family, your husband, you've tried to quit. And you've mentioned, um, your grandson.. Your grandson.. his recent, uh, diagnosis with pre - diabetes has left you very very very very very scared. Your family is, has become, very important to you.<|endoftext|>It sounds like your husband, uh, has also had some difficulty. Um, you tried some diet programs, um, but didn't quite like the taste of those programs.<|endoftext|>This is from your past experiences of trying to
So you're concerned about your health<|endoftext|>So you are, you said you were not too... Because your adherence
Um, so it sounds like from the medication, from the nutrition labeling, that the nutritionists, the nutritionists, have kind of got in the way for you in terms of communicating with your doctor about nutrition labeling.<|endoftext|>Three recent papers, by two different authors,
Okay. So h - hmm. Um - hmm. And so your two, um,RELATED - fad diets have been, you know, some success and fad diets<|endoftext|>Okay so, you know, eating at restaurants has been a successful one in the past, but it sounds like you've had some difficulty before with those, you know, the diets,<|endoftext|>A once a week exercise
So energetic.<|endoftext|>T. So energetic.<|endoftext|>This is a good one. So you mentioned you know your family is very important to you, and you are very busy. There's two, you know, two busy working mother and a busy working father. And, um, so this is the time where you are most, uh, at a cross
and you, because you, because you're, because you want to be there for your family and you want to be around.<|endoftext|>T. You're willing
Yeah, so its a way that you get some exercise.<|endoftext|>A cigarrette is a must. It tastes good. It tastes good.<|endoftext|>Okay so the two of
So you don't want to have to deal with all the other complications that come with losing weight.<|endoftext|>I remember you talking about how important it was that you, um... got your father and not... went...<|endoftext|>So it is very important to you to not... you Don't want to end up going down that road again...<|endoftext|>Ok. So it sounds like we have something... a little bit of something in between... between success and failure.<|endoftext|>From what you said earlier, you know that you're really motivated to make improvements to your diet and lifestyle. And you
So keeping your body warm helps you feel better and less active.<|endoftext|>A very important value for you.<|endoftext|>It seems like your effectiveness at this point has kind of plateaued at a certain point. Or maybe it's just starting out. Or maybe it just hasn't
And you really didn't like the way the taste of the gum.<|endoftext|>So you've been smoking for a very long time...<|endoftext|>T....and its daily, it sounds like. And having your grandson, uh, being around makes it really important for
Ok. So making it a 10, or making it a regiment...<|endoftext|>She's reminding you...it's important.<|endoftext|>Okay. So we've covered most of the important things you need to know about HIV at
T. - and that would be a little bit healthier.<|endoftext|>Okay so that's the first time you've ever been diagnosed with anything.<|endoftext|>Okay so uhm, at first you thought that was a viral -
Um, and it's been difficult to swallow because you
T. And, and we've talked about a couple of different ideas, we've talked about maybe a medication like that might work for you. And it seems like you fear that you might be hurting him, or... because of your smoking.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you fear that your smoking can might be hurting him as well.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you and your
Okay, so you mentioned umm good parent and responsible as a good parent...<|endoftext|>This time instead of a cigarette, you're
You said " in control. "<|endoftext|>It's important. Uh huh.<|endoftext|>It's really important. Okay.<|endoftext|>A little bit frustratingly loud.<|endoftext|>A little bit frustrating.<|endoftext|>Complexity and lack of adherence. Right.
So, it sounds like your kids are a major reason for you wanting to become this strong. It sounds like they're a big reason why you want to [?? ]<|endoftext|>It sounds like they're a big reason for you wanting to [?? ]<|endoftext|>It sounds like they're just sort of hanging in there, yeah. So -
So then you mentioned that it's something you grab from time to time but it's something you don't really want to eat all the time.<|endoftext|>T. Okay. I remember you talking about that. You said that you weren't really into fad diets.<|endoftext|>T. Um, ok, so maybe if we talk about healthier options you could talk about maybe looking at the menu at the fast food restaurant and seeing which one is available and seeing which one you can make yourself<|endoftext|>This is going to
So you just want to know about the nutrition labeling<|endoftext|>Some people say that you have to not eat certain things...<|endoftext|>A Chicago family is about to lose its health care. That's going to be a hard thing for you to swallow.<|endoftext|>You have never heard of weight loss pills. You have heard of diets.<|endoftext|>Not the fad diets that you
So we've talked about some options, um, like stopping short of quitting completely and exploring other options that might be on the table.<|endoftext|>It sounds like a good example to you as far as, um, being able to come up with some of these other things.<|endoftext|>A good example to you as far as the medications you are taking from the medication
You've mentioned that you'd like some exercise too.<|endoftext|>Your kids are already really involved, so why not some healthy options<|endoftext|>This is from your past experiences of dealing with trying to quit smoking. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm sorry you
So you've tried to quit before and it just hasn't worked out for the long term<|endoftext|>A 23 year old bookstore employee was recently diagnosed with pre - diabetes because she doesn't have a good control.
Ohh. Okay. So that means there's a long term condition, even though you're not getting well fast, that you want to learn more about maybe how to live with the symptoms of diabetes and that can be the motivation to change.<|endoftext|>This is from the time when you were 16 and had knee pain because you weren't exercising. That's because you were dealing with knee pain daily.<|endoftext|>It sounds like even though you have knee pain that you still don't really exercise as much outside of your home.<|endoftext|>That sounds like you were a good parent and responsible for your weight.<|endoftext|>You want D4s
And you have a gum, so again, it might be a little bit different.<|endoftext|>Three cheers for being able to quit.<|endoftext|>Okay so you've tried nicotine replacement therapy<|endoftext|>
T. Um, so physical activity is kind of, one of those out there<|endoftext|>Yea. You're not very active. You said you swim?<|endoftext|>A
hmm.<|endoftext|>T. Cause you were saying that the worst part was the withdrawal.<|endoftext|>You're finding that your medication can irritate other people around you as well.<|endoftext|>This is from your past experiences in trying to quit smoking: "This is from my past experiences of trying to quit smoking. I've tried cold turkey and it didn't work. I tried to stop cold turkey and it just hasn't
that you, you know, if there's something that's going on that's going to affect your
T. Um and then, um, you tried nicotine gum, and it didn't work out for you<|endoftext|>It's a little scary. So the thought is that if you
and so you want to start making changes<|endoftext|>Aureus Software worked for a while with Microsoft and it just hasn't been very successful so now it has a new lease on its own<|endoftext|>Just drive. It works.<|endoftext|>Yea. So it sounds like you've been smoking for a long time now.<|endoftext|>Okay. So actually it's been a long time since you've
T. And then really preparing yourself not to do that again.<|endoftext|>Okay so um so. So you know that the gum is definitely not helping you're weight issues in terms of, maybe that
Yeah, so that's why you get tired...<|endoftext|>So you said you had a long weekend...<|endoftext|>It's an eight.<|endoftext|>Yes. And so then in working with your family it sounds like you have to do it for yourself. So you
It's a three or a two<|endoftext|>T. Ok. So. So it sounds like, um, you've tried the diabetic diet and the fad diets and that kind of just hasn't worked out for you.<|endoftext|>T. Ok. So. And you've tried to do some exercise, like what you did in college.<|endoftext|>This is not something that's
94. Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>It sounds like it's pretty important to you.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you mentioned medication.<|endoftext|>You mentioned nicotine replacement therapy.<|endoftext|>Okay. And so it sounds like you've
T. Um. And so I guess that's where you were at with that, in terms of the - in your concern
And sometimes it's just hard for you to remember, you know because you're so busy.<|endoftext|>From the look on your face, you were sure that you could take your pills<|endoftext|>Sounds like when I asked you if you wanted a piece of fruit to cut
T....and the taste.<|endoftext|>This is from the point where we were talking about just kind of using these little miscellaneous like a little bit of extra motivation to boost your metabolism.<|endoftext|>Three or a four.<|endoftext|>There is something about that that that -<|endoftext|>So it sounds like there's a little bit of something for everybody<|endoftext|>T. Alright. Okay, so uhm, so um, on
So, physical fitness is very important to you.<|endoftext|>Three very good reasons why you find the gym is because you like to work out. You enjoy the gym and you like to be active.<|endoftext|>A three or a
So, you were worried about the taste and the way it might affect your ability to be there for your family, to be around.<|endoftext|>It sounds like kinda a middle ground. It's not all the time everyone's using all the time, so it sounds like there's a lot of times where you're just kinda hanging out at home smoking.<|endoftext|>T. Ok, so kind of having that back up support and then hearing from your doctor about these medications. That's
A three or a high three?<|endoftext|>There's a very good reason to get this done.<|endoftext|>Emmett
So it sounds like you really want to get your medications and be really tired...<|endoftext|>For a while you've been able to stay up and take your medications at the right time. Now you need a little bit
There's been no successes.<|endoftext|>This is a list of the things that are out there for you. And being able to make those changes will help you you kind of feel better about yourself and feel better about yourself...<|endoftext|>Oh. So your sister has arthritis. That's terrible.<|endoftext|>In that sense, it sounds like life is a living breathing thing.<|endoftext|>It can be hard. Being
- within the next month, or so.<|endoftext|>T. Ok, well that's better than nothing.<|endoftext|>She's a single mom.<|endoftext|>
So it sounds like there's some...this...this connection that we haven't explored yet between the pain and the...<|endoftext|>Um, okay
Seems like your father's knee.<|endoftext|>This is not a good time to be cold turkey. (from a food blog)<|endoftext|>A little bit of fast food is good for you. I made myself a little bit healthier by eating some fruits and vegetables.<|endoftext|>Okay so it sounds like umm...you had some success at the beginning of the week,
So, it sounds like you have some pretty extensive dietary restrictions that you're taking on.<|endoftext|>It sounds like um, you can spend a lot more time at your own work when you're not at
Seven or eight<|endoftext|>T. Uhm. Okay. So I just to get, um, a little bit of range, you said that's very important.<|endoftext|>I'm sorry. I - Okay. Um - You've mentioned that you were in a clinic at the
T. Yeah, you're not too, too confident that you can maintain that level of health in yourself without medication.<|endoftext|>About This Course

And helps you kind of get through.<|endoftext|>Aired on -
This is from the Archives Room. It's
it sounds like youre having a lot of difficulty tolerating the increased side effects of the medications and also how it affects your daily life.<|endoftext|>Akinokweil, a.k.a.<|endoftext|>For those who are interested
So it's like a reminder<|endoftext|>It's a reminder of just how little privacy there is...<|endoftext|>It sounds like the two of you are talking about that your husband has a pretty good reason to be on your feet all day...<|endoftext|>Okay. So when you say that you don't want to talk about it any more...you're not afraid you'll get cold
so no side effects<|endoftext|>Because you were feeling better,<|endoftext|>Ok. So far we have you know, you do know that the medications are not going to make you feel better, you get sick again...<|endoftext|>So you mentioned that the up to eight weeks is a good time to start meds, but this is when you were most kind of overwhelmed with the side effects.<|endoftext|>There
- within the next month, or so.<|endoftext|>Does that mean you want a two - to three week break for your health?<|endoftext|>Well, yeah because you mentioned that it may be a two - to three week break for your health. Isn't that a
that you value in life.<|endoftext|>I did hear that when you were talking about wanting to quit smoking, that was one of the hardest things you've
T. Ok, so you mentioned that your sister also reminds you...<|endoftext|>A lot of people might not be supportive of you or... like you, you have maybe a little bit of support
T. And so you're really fearful of what your future could look like if things continue to escalate...<|endoftext|>It sounds like you've been able to find support...<|endoftext|>A lot of people say
Mmm hm.<|endoftext|>Multiple sclerosis have a negative impact on your daily life.<|endoftext|>This is from a talk I gave at a talk I
so just to kinda have your, um, daily successes and just to have, um, a really good time...<|endoftext|>Ok so just to get your confidence back it's important for you to quit smoking.<|endoftext|>You said you were in the
And so that just being able to talk to people<|endoftext|>And they can tell you what the medication is and can tell you what to do<|endoftext|>So it sounds like rather than a drug alternative that you and your friends have been talking about, that's what you're hearing from your
Okay. Um and so. Um and so, you believe that your children are a big reason why you are doing this and you feel that your children are
Once you get to that point, you feel like you can then, you realize it's not an option<|endoftext|>T. As far as I'm concerned, you just haven't heard of
So you think the extra stress that comes with smoking helps you with your weight -<|endoftext|>You've mentioned being a mother.<|endoftext|>So it sounds like you, um, feeling a lot of responsibility from your own life and seeing how other people have dealt with mental health problems and um, that has an issue with being a good parent. And so having that not be a priority..<|endoftext|>Ok. So I guess having a positive role model in your children's eyes, um, is a positive.<|endoftext|>Sure. So, um, that was kind of like a stress relief. So, um, you want to be a good parent...<|endoftext|>T
T. Whereas, you know, eating like this is not healthy for you.<|endoftext|>A friend of mine just made the comment that you're not getting well fast. You're seeing some
So for you it might be a positive.<|endoftext|>And then it also sounds like your husband being a positive, um, is perhaps why you think that maybe, even though the pills may not be the best of options for you when it comes to finding a good fit, it is important for
OK, so it sounds that you do value your grandson's health and you want to maintain it as a priority. And maintaining relationships with your family is very important to you. And you feel that you have a lot of decisions to make as you continue to treatment and to reduce your smoking, which you feel is very important to you. And your a 2nd goal, obviously, is, you know, interfering with your ability to lose weight.<|endoftext|>A 4 - hour drive seems like it's a can't go
That you can do at home.<|endoftext|>In the past you've tried to do some form of physical activity, like sweating and vigorous activity.<|endoftext|>Yea. So if you could just think back to when you were maybe a pre - diabetic, that's what kind of stuck...<|endoftext|>This is from the last time we
T. And, you don't have to think about it, you just have to, it's, it's an option.<|endoftext|>#7. Okay, um. So we're going to cut
Um, and your sister has also joined the 2, so, we've added up all the people that we know that are interested in you.<|endoftext|>You don't want to quit smoking, but you...<|endoftext|>It sounds like your family is very important to you...<|endoftext|>T....so why is your confidence level so high? Because you have a good parent
So it's... it's encouraging for you to get... if you can manage to do something... to take this positive step then you believe that... that that would be a good step.<|endoftext|>An 8. Um... OK. So that's a pretty high.<|endoftext|>Okay. So you said that you tried
Ok, so you mentioned umm... being in a doctor's clinic is kind of interfering with your ability to have...<|endoftext|>I mean it sounds like your daughter has some of that, but also has some...<|endoftext|>This class is not
And so this is something that's very... It's a source of support and I guess it's also... It's a source of support for the HIV community.
Pack and a half a day, okay.<|endoftext|>I've high school students and I have some college students. I can tell you there are some pretty severe outgrowths in the garages.<|endoftext|>This is from my past experiences of trying to quit smoking. You know, the parent or the responsible person is often times the one who gives you that motivation and who gives you that...<|endoftext|>I've been smoking for forty years now now. I guess it's
T. So, just to summarize, you are worried about your daughter's health, and it's something you really feel like you have a lot of responsibility for and it's something you really enjoy doing.<|endoftext|>It sounds like you have a lot on your plate already with your health, and you feel like you just don't have time to prepare meals or cook.<|endoftext|>You don't want to go
So, again this is something that, I mean it's important for you to take your medications, and yet it also sounds like it's something that you'd like to sort of maintain or break apart from the family.<|endoftext|>I'm sorry. So where do you, what kind of medications you are on and which ones you are using and which ones you don't. Unfortunately we don't have any labeling on the medications.<|endoftext|>In the past it sounds like you had some success with these diets, which really helped you lose the weight.<|endoftext|>Okay so you mentioned some
T. And, perhaps, ween yourself off of it over time<|endoftext|>63. That's okay. So really preparing yourself...<|endoftext|>A
So one thing that I hear you saying that you like to cook and you want to be healthy.<|endoftext|>Your daughter has concerns for her weight as well.<|endoftext|>Because she's concerned with the amount of smoking in her body as well.<|endoftext|>It sounds like it's a concern of yours as well.<|endoftext|>A barbecue. It sounds like smoking
That sounds like you had some pretty bad experiences with quitting.<|endoftext|>So yeah - on one hand you're really anxious and feel that if you keep going it will just be the two of you, you know, coming to blows.<|endoftext|>At first it seems like you had really bad self - control. Maybe it was because of the medications. Maybe it was because of the, um, you know
And you had that feeling that maybe if you did try to schedule a clinic appointment with your doctor,
So, if you had a well thought out plan, and you were ready to quit smoking, and you were ready to try to quit, and your husband and you had kind of, um, concerns at um, with either of those two things becoming a barrier.<|endoftext|>T
So yea so what's, what issues are, what are some of the issues that you're dealing with now?<|endoftext|>T. Um. So your family, your grandson... that you really value your grandson and he... not... falls in with the obesity.<|endoftext|>T. Um. And you just don't know if you can lose that weight cause you haven't been successful yet but that's something that you're interested in doing.<|endoftext|>About three weeks ago you made the decision
You feel like you've failed...<|endoftext|>This is from your past experiences of trying to lose weight. So in terms of, kind of, the struggle you've been dealing with is the struggle you have with trying to kind of kind of fathom out there<|endoftext|>So you mentioned several things are trying to do that are kind of
Not just being there for your children -<|endoftext|>Ok, so um. So you said your HIV viral load is 1.5 to 1.5 million.<|endoftext|>So the main things when you're dealing with getting

T. And you mentioned earlier, the exercise part.<|endoftext|>A two or three times a week is better for you.
