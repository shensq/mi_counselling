So that concerns me and then I take care of my little grandson on weekends and he was recently hospitalized with an asthma attack and of course his physician doesn't want him around smoke even second hand smoke. And so that really got my attention I really felt terrible and so I thought this is a good time to really think about giving up smoking.\n",

      "C:\tWell just overall health I don't want to have any respiratory problems and um I've had pneumonia in the past and I would say you know overall health I hate the smoke on my clothes that's another reason why I've got to give it up so yeah but I'd say the main reasons being my health and my grandsons health.\n",

      "C:\tWell, I failed miserably um the first time I quit was when my children were still at home. Um younger still teenagers and bugging me to give up smoking. So I tried and found I couldn't do it, failed miserably. The second time um was when I turned fifty I thought it would be a nice way to start a new decade and kind of the same problems as the first time and the third and final time I tried a couple of years ago um I was probably off it the longest and I did try Nicorette gum. So I don't know if that's why I was off it the longest or not but I hated the taste of the gum, kind of a peppery taste. And I'm just not a gum chewer and honestly I didn't like that.\n",

And, um, I think we were all a little bit successful, most of us at the beginning. And then we would get to the point where - oh, for whatever reason. You know, everybody had their own different reasons as to why they didn't do it anymore. And then- then all of the sudden you're back to the same old stuff that you used to do before.

Because that's apparently that part that I'm not- I can make it work at first, but I'm not good at- at the stayin' part.\n",
      "T:\tSo. You. So. Okay. So. Um. What's most difficult is that, you know, you have maybe a diet that you're trying and then it maybe just gets too high to follow or is it just that- do you find that you want to eat other foods and kinda give in? Or what- what kind of goes through your head when you're following this- this diet?\n",
      "C:\tYeah, I do want some of the other foods that aren't on it. And so you always - first you feel kinda guilty and you feel like you're cheating and stuff like that. And then finally you just- just give it up and do it anyway.\n",

      "T:\tYeah. Um. So what do you- what would you say is kind of the biggest, the hardest part for you then when you were trying to, you know, was it the, um, what- um- yeah, the biggest struggles for you in staying with the diet?\n",
      "C:\tI would say ...  long-term. That whatever it is, that I need to do, um, I can't apparently get done in a short amount of time.

And, um, it came from my family's, um, my mom and my sister and even my dad's a little over...  My mom's real over weight and, um, my dad is overweight and has diabetes.  And, um, my sister is overweight.  So I come from a family of people that, you know, have a tendency to be overweight.  And then recently my doctor told me that I am now pre-diabetic and that I need to get a hold of, you know, this issue.  And so that's what I'm doing here.\n",

He's type II but he's, um, been you know he's been through the ringer.  He's on dialysis right now.  And he had, um, first... about two years ago he had his toe removed and then they had to take it off at the ankle and now he's got below the knee on one leg so, his whole life is going back and forth to dialysis.  He's in a wheel chair, and um, I, I mean I just, I just can't even imagine my life being limited like his is.\n",

And my sister, you know, she doesn't have Diabetes or, um, high blood pressure right now but she's also overweight and is having trouble with some of her joints and of course mine are achy but I, um, haven't had a lot of trouble there yet.  But I can see where this is all going and so, um, my doctor thinks I need to make some changes.\n",
      "T:\tYeah! And that's definitely something that's important to do and it's very good that you understand and that you see how starting and trying to prevent that from increasing, how that's important to your health and your life and you see from your dad at first hand that it can lead to negative heath outcomes and effects and also that your mother and your sister developing health conditions like high blood pressure that that's something that you definitely want to get a hold of.

      "C:\tA lot of behaviors. I'm a teacher so one of the things that I find myself doing is picking my son up from the high school, I meant the middle school, and my daughter's at home, she's going to community college, and, uh, we're starving and, you know, we've been at it since 6am and we're both at school early and then, uh, we come home and all I can think of is we've got to eat dinner and so we go to the drive through. I know that's not good but almost every day, every weekday, we have take out or we go through the drive through and then Friday night we have pizza. So I know I'm not eating right.  At all.\n",
      "T:\tOkay, and so you mentioned that you have, uh, an early morning.  What is, what is your breakfast, uh, schedule or routine look like? Is there...?\n",
      "C:\tWell, we get up and, you know, there's, um, my son and I we both, of course we both shower and what not and I make some coffee first but then most of the days we're going through Tim Horton's and getting something quick or through McDonalds and getting an Egg McMuffin or, you know, something sausage biscuit. Um, so most of the days we start off with fast food and that's where we end up too. And then in the evenings we snack a lot.\n",
      "T:\tOkay.  So it sounds like you may not think you have enough time in the morning and night to cook so that leads to you going to fast food restaurants for food for both yourself and your family.\n",
      "\t\tCR Okay. So it sounds like you may not think you have enough time in the morning and night to cook so that leads to you going to fast food restaurants for food for both yourself and your family.\n",
      "C:\tYeah, well, I'm on my feet all day long teaching, you know, and I, I don't know if I could walk anymore than I do.  I mean I'm on my feet and I'm walking back and forth to the office or walking around my classroom, you know.  Um, so I'm tired.  I'm worn out.  I, I couldn't imagine standing, you know, next to the stove and having to stand there for an additional hour trying to get dinner going.\n",
      "T:\tOkay. So just to kind of gauge where you are.  How important is it that you take these precautionary steps  through your behaviors?  Such as we kind of mentioned that not having, er, not feeling capable of cooking because you're tired or you don't have the time.  How important is it for you to start cooking so that you don't have to worry about, um, going to get fast food which can increase your, um, risk for, uh, overweight and weight gain and some of those poor nutrition factors that lead to the, uh, diabetes and high blood pressure that your family has experienced.\n",
      "C:\tWell it seems important, but I don't know if it's possible.\n",
      "T:\tOkay.  It seems important, but you don't think it's possible.  Okay.  So on a scale from 0 to 10 with 10 being the most important.  Where would you put that?\n",

And, I would say it worked a little in terms of discouraging wanting to smoke, but it tasted so much like dirt that I dreaded taking a piece of gum and putting it in my mouth. So, it was kind of inevitable after a week or so of struggling with it that, that wasn't going to work. So, I just kind of let it be and went back to my happy days of smoking. And then, about two years ago, I decided to go cold turkey to quit. And I turned into an absolute monster. My sweet darling husband, he just...I think he was...while he wants me to not be smoking, he was, in a way, relieved that I went back to smoking after a couple of weeks of this. And I, I wasn't pleasant around my grandchild and, you know, that was a really big thing as far as I was concerned. So, I just decided that cold turkey just would not work for me. You know? Then, I just went back to my regular bad habit. And... now, I really want to, you know, have an end with it.\n",

One thing leads to another and then you start smoking more and more. Like, if you have, you know, exams to cram for, things like that. Then, it went from social, to studying, to, you know, just about anything would make you want to have a cigarette.\n",

So, the diagnosis was frightening, but what's even more frightening is if I can't get some of this weight off, I'm gonna go down the same road.\n",

      "T:\tYes. Exactly.\n",
      "C:\tYes and um, so, tell me about, you know, your recent weight loss attempts; so have you tried anything recently?\n",
      "T:\tYeah, I mean, I've been trying on and off since I got out of college, which was a lot of years ago, but during high school and college I never had a problem because I played team sports, and I was active, so I burned off everything I ate.\n",
      "C:\tSo you didn't really have to think about your weight then, because you were so active and doing things, so that the weight just kind of took care of itself?\n",
      "T:\tYes, Yeah, so. But then after and I got married shortly after college and started having kids and you know, then you put on weight and then stress takes over and responsibilities, and you - I just - I have probably gained maybe forty pounds in the last fifteen years. And, um, so I would say that at least once a year I try some fad diet, whether it's - I've tried Atkins, I've tried South Beach, I've tried all of 'em. You know, stuff that has been in magazines and - and they work for a while. You know, I had been able to lose fifteen or twenty pounds, but then the minute I stop the diet, or go off the diet - I mean, plus.\n",
      "C:\tIt's just frustrating, 'cuz you put in all this hard work, and then it all comes back, and you don't understand why, and you know in the past it was just so easy to keep off, but now you've got kids, you've got work, you may gotta deal with your husband, your dad's not feeling well, you know, he's got diabetes, so it's a lot to think about.\n",
      "T:\tYes. Right, right, it is, it is. And, and I guess I'm really worried that it - it's not just a matter of looks anymore, it's a matter of, you know, am I getting diabetes if I don't lose weight?\n",
      "C:\tYeah, but the concept of diabetes, and all the complications that can come from that is pretty frightening, you know. On the one hand you still want to enjoy the food, but on the other hand, you see that, you know, food can, is pretty [??] diabetes and then you know-\n",
      "T:\tYeah.\n",
      "C:\t-the exercises [??] in component two. Tell me about like, any sort of exercise, you can - you think you can try any exercise recently, any like joining the gym or anything?\n",
      "T:\tNo, I mean, I just uh, I like to work around the garden, you know I like to work outside, I like to cut the lawn, I - anything that involves getting outside I enjoy. Now, that's coming pretty soon. But you know the winter, you don't get to do things like that.\n",
      "C:\tSo, you set inside your house a lot during winter, you weren't able to go outside in your garden, and you just didn't have that [??] burn some calories to help you sort of, losing that weight. So, tell me, are you seeing a doctor at all about your weight? I mean, is there-\n",
      "T:\tUm, well the one that diagnosed me, yeah. I mean, he sent me to this class so that I could learn. I think he hopefully maybe thought it would scare me into doing something. But it just, it - it - I am scared, because I know I have to succeed this time, whereas before it was just a matter of losing weight for somebody's wedding, or you know, getting into a bathing suit or something. And now that stuff isn't important.\n",

I you know most of 'em have all been on my own just magazine diets or the Atkins diet. The South Beach. Things that I heard about and went off and bought the book. Um. And [sigh] they work for a little while and then I just lose my motivation somehow and something will come up like, you know, a birthday party or a vacation and I go off my diet and I just can't seem to get back on it and then I gain my weight back.\n",

And now that I've gotten heavier and older, my knees kind of bother me so you know like if I were to go to the gym or or try to jog or anything like that it would bother my knees.

I'm I'm I usually accomplish what I try and uh um. . . I was very frustrated when I could not do that for them. And for myself I guess, but maybe more for them at that time.

      "C:\tWell the first time, I think I made it, maybe, six days. The second time I tried I probably made it four. The, the, um, side effects and withdrawal symptoms were so great, that I just, you know, I just couldn't handle it. But the third time I tried some of that Nicorette gum. And, you know, um, it didn't taste really good or anything, but it wasn't that, I at least made it longer. I think I made it like ten days. But I, um, I went back. Probably one reason of course was the side effects. And the other reason was I didn't know what to do. I mean I had all this extra time and I didn't know what to do with it.\n",

      "C:\tWell just how, you know, weight can affect diabetes, and just by taking off some weight umm a lot of people can avoid actually going into diabetes. You know, I have a father that's diabetic, and I've seen the ravages of what it's done to his body, and I'm terrified of ending up like that. He lost a leg below his knee and he's on chemo dialysis for his kidneys, and I don't want that to happen to me.\n",

      "T:\tOk. And so, yeah, that's pretty important. What would it take for you to be at a 10?\n",
      "C:\tAhh, if I was already being diagnosed as diabetic.\n",
      "T:\tOk. So then you would know that then I really need to change because this is something that's already happened. Where right now you seem to be, you know, like, there's other things I could probably do and it's really important but it's not dire yet.\n",

In fact, they were the ones, they had that health unit where they're learning all about the lungs and all that stuff and they kept everyday, \"Mom, mom you gotta quit, you gotta quit\". So I, I just one day just sorta to  surrender them and said, \"Okay, I'll quit, I'll get rid of the cigarettes ... I'll stop smoking.\"  ... .And, it was, it was really awful. I mean, I, uh, it was a very bad experience for all of us and so, um, I couldn't  do it. Uh I felt really bad about it but I went back to smoking and everybody else felt better about it because (laughing) I was no longer a miserable mother. And then the second time I tried I, um, when I turned fifty, and I thought well you know I should be able to be in control of myself at this point. I should be able to defeat this, and, couldn't do it. And then the last time I tried, umm, it was just a couple years ago, um and one of the most frustrating parts of that was I went to Meier and I looked at all the, uh, the different nicotine replacement things and stuff, and I tried the gum ... and I guess I thought it would be, you know, sorta like this miracle and everything would be fine and dandy, and it wasn't, so ...\n",

It's been a slow progression and through those years I have tried different things, you know you just turn on the computer or pick up a magazine and there's, I don't know every different magazine has a different diet plan for you. It's either berries or y'know cabbage diet or the berry drink or the this or the that, you know there's Atkins.

I know that I don't make the best food choices for my family. I was divorced about five years ago, and I'm a teacher and so my kids are in high school and one's in high school and one's in community college. The easiest thing is to get out of school get my son from school, go through the drive thru and by the time we're home we're eating dinner, the minute we walk in we're all hungry and there's dinner, ready.

I take care of my little grandson on the weekends and he was recently hospitalized for an asthma attack. And his physician does not want him around smoke, even second hand smoke. Now, I have tried to go outside when he is there but it's not always possible. You know, when I know I have smoke on my clothes, so I felt absolutely horrible. I felt totally responsible.

I had this bout with bronchitis, and...I swim about three times a week and I've noticed that I've developed some shortness of breath swimming, and also I have a little grandson that I take care of on the weekends, that was recently hospitalized with an asthma attack, and so I think that was the final straw for me, because obviously his physician does not want him around people who smoke. And I try not to smoke around him, but you know, sometimes it's not always possible. So I thought these were wake-up calls between my health and my grandson's health that I needed to seriously think about giving up smoking.\n",

      "T:\tWell, great, so I guess if I were to ask you on a scale of 0-10, it sounds like you have a lot of reasons, a lot of kind of values of why you might want to quit. So on a scale of 0-10, how motivated would you say you are to begin the quitting process?\n",

      "C:\tUm, well I guess because I have to admit I kind of enjoy smoking. I kind of dread the thoughts of giving it up -- it's kind of my friend. So, I would say that would be the reason.\n",

So, you know,when I was 20-30 pounds overweight I would, you know, try the Atkins diet or I would try the south beach diet or, you know, diets I would see in magazines and things.
